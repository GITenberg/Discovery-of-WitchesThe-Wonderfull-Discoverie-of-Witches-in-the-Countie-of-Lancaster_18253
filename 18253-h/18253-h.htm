<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Were</span> not every chapter of the history of the human mind too precious
an inheritance to be willingly relinquished,&#8212;for appalling as its
contents may be, the value of the materials it may furnish may be
inestimable,&#8212;we might otherwise be tempted to wish that the miserable
record in which the excesses occasioned by the witch mania are
narrated, could be struck out of its pages, and for ever cancelled.
Most assuredly, he, who is content to take the fine exaggeration of
the author of <i>Hydriotaphia</i> as a serious and literal truth, and who
believes with him that &quot;man is a glorious animal,&quot; must not go to the
chapter which contains that record for his evidences and proofs. If he
should be in search of materials for humiliation and abasement, he
will find in the history of witchcraft in this country, from the
beginning to the end of the seventeenth century, large and abundant
materials, whether it affects the species or the individual. In truth,
human nature is never seen in worse colours than in that dark and
dismal review. Childhood, without any of its engaging properties,
appears prematurely artful, wicked and cruel<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; woman, the victim of
a wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> and debasing bigotry, has yet so little of the feminine
adjuncts, that the fountains of our sympathies are almost closed; and
man, tyrannizing over the sex he was bound to protect, in its helpless
destitution and enfeebled decline, seems lost in prejudice and
superstition and only strong in oppression. If we turn from the common
herd to the luminaries of the age, to those whose works are the
landmarks of literature and science, the reference is equally
disappointing;&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;The sun itself is dark<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>
<p>We find the illustrious author of the Novum Organon sacrificing to
courtly suppleness his philosophic truth, and gravely prescribing the
ingredients for a witches' ointment;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&#8212;Raleigh, adopting miserable
fallacies at second hand, without subjecting them to the crucible of
his acute and vigorous understanding;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&#8212;Selden, maintaining that
crimes of the imagination may be punished with death;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&#8212;The detector
of Vulgar Errors, and the most humane of physicians,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> giving the
casting weight to the vacillating bigotry of Sir Matthew
Hale;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&#8212;Hobbes, ever sceptical, penetrating and sagacious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> yet here
paralyzed, and shrinking from the subject as if afraid to touch
it;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&#8212;The adventurous explorer, who sounded the depths and channels
of the &quot;Intellectual System&quot; along all the &quot;wide watered&quot; shores of
antiquity, running after witches to hear them recite the Common Prayer
and the Creed, as a rational test of guilt or innocence;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&#8212;The
gentle spirit of Dr. Henry More, girding on the armour of persecution,
and rousing itself from a Platonic reverie on the Divine Life, to
assume the hood and cloak of a familiar of the Inquisition;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&#8212;and
the patient and enquiring Boyle, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> aside for a while his
searches for the grand Magisterium, and listening, as if spell-bound,
with gratified attention to stories of witches at Oxford, and devils
at Mascon.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nor is it from a retrospect of our own intellectual
progress only that we find how capricious, how intermitting, and how
little privileged to great names or high intellects, or even to those
minds which seemed to possess the very qualifications which would
operate as conductors, are those illuminating gleams of common sense
which shoot athwart the gloom, and aid a nation on its tardy progress
to wisdom, humanity, and justice. If on the Continent there were, in
the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> century, two men from whom an exposure of the
absurdities of the system of witchcraft might have been naturally and
rationally expected, and who seem to stand out prominently from the
crowd as predestined to that honourable and salutary office, those two
men were John Bodin<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and Thomas Erastus.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The former a
lawyer&#8212;much exercised in the affairs of men&#8212;whose learning was not
merely umbratic&#8212;whose knowledge of history was most philosophic and
exact&#8212;of piercing penetration and sagacity&#8212;tolerant&#8212;liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
minded&#8212;disposed to take no proposition upon trust, but to canvass and
examine every thing for himself, and who had large views of human
nature and society&#8212;in fact, the Montesquieu of the seventeenth
century. The other, a physician and professor, sage, judicious,
incredulous,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks,&quot;</p></div>

<p>who had routed irrecoverably empiricism in almost every
shape&#8212;Paracelsians&#8212;Astrologers&#8212;Alchemists&#8212;Rosicrucians&#8212;and who
weighed and scrutinized and analyzed every conclusion, from
excommunication and the power of the keys to the revolutions of comets
and their supposed effects on empires, and all with perfect
fearlessness and intuitive insight into the weak points of an
argument. Yet, alas! for human infirmity. Bodin threw all the weight
of his reasoning and learning and vivacity into the scale of the witch
supporters, and made the &quot;hell-broth boil and bubble&quot; anew, and
increased the witch <i>furor</i> to downright fanaticism, by the
publication of his <i>Demo-manie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a work in which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Learning, blinded first and then beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks dark as ignorance, as frenzy wild;&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but which it is impossible to read without being carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> along by the
force of mind and power of combination which the author manifests, and
without feeling how much ingenious sophistry can perform to mitigate
and soften the most startling absurdity. His contemporary, Erastus,
after all his victories on the field of imposition, was foiled by the
subject of witchcraft at last. This was his pet delusion&#8212;almost the
only one he cared not to discard&#8212;like the dying miser's last
reserve:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8212;&#8212; &quot;My manor, sir? he cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that, I cannot part with that,&#8212;and died.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his treatise <i>De Lamiis</i>, published in 1577, 8vo., he defends
nearly all the absurdities of the system with a blind zealotry which
in such a man is very remarkable. His book has accordingly taken its
place on the same shelf with Sprenger, Remigius, Delrio, and De
Lancre, and deserves insertion only in a list which has yet to be made
out, and which if accurately compiled would be a literary curiosity,
of the singularly illogical books of singularly able reasoners. What
was left unaccomplished by the centurions of literature came
ultimately from the strangest of all possible quarters; from the study
of an humble pupil of the transmuter of metals and prince of
mountebanks and quacks&#8212;the expounder of Reuchlin <i>de verbo mirifico</i>,
and lecturer in the unknown tongues&#8212;the follower of
Trismegistus&#8212;cursed with bell, book and candle, by every decorous
Church in Christendom&#8212;the redoubted Cornelius Agrippa; who, if he
left not to his pupil Wierus the secret of the philosopher's stone or
grand elixir, seems to have communicated a treasure perhaps equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
rare and not less precious, the faculty of seeing a truth which should
open the eyes of bigotry and dispel the mists of superstition, which
should stop the persecution of the helpless and stay the call for
blood. If, in working out this virgin ore from the mine, he has
produced it mixed up with the <i>scoria</i> of his master's <i>Occult
Philosophy</i>; if he gives us catalogues of devils and spirits, with
whose acquaintance we could have dispensed; if he pleads the great
truth faintly, inconsistently, imperfectly, and is evidently unaware
of the strength of the weapons he wields; these deductions do not the
less entitle Wierus to take his place in the first rank of Humanity's
honoured professors, the true philanthropists and noble benefactors of
mankind.</p>

<p>In our own country, it may be curious and edifying to observe to whom
we mainly owe those enlightened views on this subject, which might
have been expected to proceed in their natural channel, but for which
we look in vain, from the &quot;triumphant heirs of universal praise,&quot; the
recognized guides of public opinion, whose fame sheds such a lustre on
our annals,&#8212;the Bacons, the Raleighs, the Seldens, the Cudworths, and
the Boyles.</p>

<p>The strangely assorted and rather grotesque band to whom we are
principally indebted for a vindication of outraged common sense and
insulted humanity in this instance, and whose vigorous exposition of
the absurdities of the prevailing system, in combination with other
lights and sources of intelligence, led at last to its being
universally abandoned, consists of four individuals&#8212;on any of whom a
literary Pharisee would look down with supercilious scorn:&#8212;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> country
gentleman, devoted to husbandry, and deep in platforms of hop
gardens,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&#8212;a baronet, whose name for upwards of a century has been
used as a synonyme for incurable political bigotry,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&#8212;a little,
crooked, and now forgotten man, who died, as his biographer tells us,
&quot;distracted, occasioned by a deep conceit of his own parts, and by a
continual bibbing of strong and high tasted liquors,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&#8212;and last,
but not least assuredly, of one who was by turns a fanatical preacher
and an obscure practitioner of physic, and who passed his old age at
Clitheroe in Lancashire in attempting to transmute metals and discover
the philosopher's stone.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> So strange a band of Apostles of reason
may occasion a smile; it deserves, at all events, a little more
particular consideration before we address ourselves to the short
narration which may be deemed necessary as an introduction to the
republication which follows.</p>

<p>Of the first of the number, Reginald or Reynold Scot, it is to be
regretted that more particulars are not known. Nearly the whole are
contained in the following information afforded by Anthony &#224; Wood,
<i>Athen&#230;.</i>, vol. i. p. 297; from which it appears that he took to
&quot;solid reading&quot; at a crisis of life when it is generally thrown aside.
&quot;Reynolde Scot, a younger son of Sir John Scot, of Scot's Hall, near
to Smeeth, in Kent, by his wife, daughter of Reynolde Pimp, of Pimp's
Court, Knight, was born in that county, and at about 17 years of age
was sent to Oxon, particularly as it seems to Hart Hall, where several
of his countrymen and name studied in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> the latter end of K. Henry
VIII. and the reign of Edward VI., &amp;c. Afterwards he retired to his
native country, without the honour of a Degree, and settled at Smeeth,
where he found great encouragement in his studies from his kinsman,
Sir Thomas Scot. <i>About which time, taking to him a wife, he gave
himself up solely to solid reading</i>, to the perusing of obscure
authors that had, by the generality of scholars, been neglected, and
at times of leisure to husbandry and gardening. He died in September
or October in 1599, and was buried among his ancestors, in the church
at Smeeth before mentioned.&quot; Retired as his life and obscure as his
death might be, he is one whose name will be remembered as long as
vigorous sense, flowing from the &quot;wells of English undefiled,&quot; hearty
and radiant humour, and sterling patriotism, are considered as
deserving of commemoration. His <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>, first
published in 1584, is indeed a treat to him who wishes to study the
idioms, manners, opinions, and superstitions of the reign of
Elizabeth. Its entire title deserves to be given:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>The discouerie of witchcraft, wherein the lewde dealing of witches
and witchmongers is notablie detected, the knauerie of coniurors, the
impietie of inchantors, the follie of soothsaiers, the impudent

<p>This title is sufficient to show that he gives no quarter to the
delusion he undertakes to expose, and though he does not deny that
there may be witches in the abstract, (to have done so would have left
him a preacher without an audience,) yet he guards so cautiously
against any practical application of that principle, and battles so
vigorously against the error which assimilated the witches of modern
times to the witches of Scripture, and, denying the validity of the
confessions of those convicted, throws such discredit and ridicule
upon the whole system, that the popular belief cannot but have
received a severe shock from the publication of his work.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> By an
extraordinary elevation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv-xvi]</a></span> good sense, he managed, not only to see
through the absurdities of witchcraft, but likewise of other errors
which long maintained their hold upon the learned as well as the
vulgar. Indeed, if not generally more enlightened, he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> in some
respects, more emancipated from delusion than even his great
successor, the learned and sagacious Webster, who, a century after,
clung still to alchemy which Reginald Scot had ridiculed and exposed.
Yet with all its strong points and broad humour, it is undeniable that
<i>The Discoverie of Witchcraft</i> only scotched the snake instead of
killing it; and that its effect was any thing but final and complete.
Inveterate error is seldom prostrated by a blow from one hand, and
truth seems to be a tree which cannot be forced by planting it before
its time. There was something, too, in the book itself which militated
against its entire acceptance by the public. It is intended to form a
little Encyclop&#230;dia of the different arts of imposition practised in
Scot's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span> time; and in order to illustrate the various tricks and modes
of cozenage, he gives us so many charms and diagrams and conjurations,
to say nothing of an inventory of seventy-nine devils and spirits, and
their several seignories and degrees, that the <i>Occult Philosophy</i> of
Cornelius Agrippa himself looks scarcely less appalling, at first
sight, than the <i>Discoverie</i>. This gave some colour to the declamation
of the author's opponents, who held him up as Wierus had been
represented before him, as if he were as deeply dipped in diabolical
practises as any of those whom he defended. Atheist and Sadducee, if
not very wizard himself, were the terms in which his name was
generally mentioned, and as such, the royal author of the <i>Demonology</i>
anathematizes him with great unction and very edifying horror. Against
the papists, the satire of Scot had been almost as much directed as
against what he calls the &quot;witch-mongers,&quot; so that that very powerful
party were to a man opposed to him. Vigorous, therefore, as was his
onslaught, its effect soon passed by; and when on the accession of
James, the statute which so long disgraced our penal code was enacted,
as the adulatory tribute of all parties, against which no honest voice
was raised, to the known opinions of the monarch, Scot became too
unfashionable to be seen on the tables of the great or in the
libraries of the learned. If he were noticed, it was only to be
traduced as a sciolist, (imperitus dialectic&#230; et aliarum bonarum
artium, says Dr. Reynolds,) and to be exposed for imagined lapses in
scholarship in an age when for a writer not to be a scholar, was like
a traveller journeying without a passport. Meric Casaubon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> who
carried all the prejudices of the time of James the first into the
reign of Charles the second, but who, though overshadowed by the fame
of his father, was no unworthy scion of that incomparable stock, at
the same time that he denounces Scot as illiterate, will only
acknowledge to having met with him &quot;at friends houses&quot; and
&quot;booksellers shops,&quot; as if his work were one which would bring
contamination to a scholar's library. Scot was certainly not a scholar
in the sense in which the term is applied to the Scaligers, Casaubons,
and Vossius's, though he would have been considered a prodigy of
reading in these days of superficial acquisition. But he had original
gifts far transcending scholarship. He had a manly, straightforward,
vigorous understanding, which, united with an honest integrity of
purpose, kept him right when greater men went wrong. How invaluable a
phalanx would the battalion of folios which the reign of James the
first produced now afford us, if the admirable mother-wit and
single-minded sincerity of Reginald Scot could only have vivified and
informed them.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>After the lapse of another half century, and at the very period when
the persecution against witches waxed hotter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span> and the public
prejudice had become only more inveterate, from the ingredient of
fanaticism having been largely thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span> in as a stimulant, another ally
to the cause of compassion and common sense started up, in the person
of one whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span> name has rounded many a period and given point to many
an invective. To find the proscribed author of the <i>Patriarcha</i>
purging with &quot;euphrasy and rue&quot; the eyes of the dispensers of justice,
and shouldering the crowd to obtain for reason a fair and impartial
hearing, is indeed like meeting with Saul among the prophets. If there
be one name which has been doomed to run the gauntlet, and against
which every pert and insolent political declaimer has had his fling,
it is that of this unfortunate writer; yet in his short but masterly
and unanswerable &quot;Advertisement to the Jurymen of England, touching
Witches, together with a difference between an English and Hebrew
Witch,&quot; first published in 1653, 4to., he has addressed himself so
cogently and decisively to the main fallacy of the arguments in favour
of witchcraft which rested their force on Scripture misunderstood, and
has so pertinently and popularly urged the points to be considered,
that his tract must have had the greatest weight on the class to whom
his reasoning was principally addressed, and on whose fiat the fates
of his unhappy clients may be said to have hung. For this good
service, reason and common sense owe Sir Robert Filmer a debt which
does not yet appear to have been paid. The verdict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> proscription
against him was pronounced by the most incompetent and superficial &#230;ra
of our literature, and no friendly appellant has yet moved the court
of posterity for its reversal. Yet without entering upon the theory of
the patriarchal scheme, which after all, perhaps, was not so
irrational as may be supposed, or discussing on an occasion like the
present the conflicting theories of government, it may be allowable to
express a doubt whether even the famous author of the &quot;Essay on the
Human Understanding,&quot; to whose culminating star the decadence of the
rival intelligence is attributable, can be shewn to have been as much
in advance of his generation in the time of king William, as from the
tract on witchcraft, and another written on a different subject, but
with equally enlightened views,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Sir Robert Filmer manifestly
appears to have outrun his at the period of the usurpation.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span></p><p>The next champion in this unpopular cause, John Wagstaffe, who
published &quot;The Question of Witchcraft Debated,&quot; 1669, 12mo,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> was,
as A. &#224; Wood informs us, &quot;the son of John Wagstaffe, citizen of
London, descended from those of his name of Hasland Hall, in
Derbyshire, was born in Cheapside, within the city of London, became a
commoner of Oriel College in the latter end of 1649, took the degrees
in Arts, and applied himself to the study of politics and other
learning. At length, being raised from an academical life to the
inheritance of Hasland, by the death of an uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span> who died without
male issue, he spent his life afterwards in single estate.&quot; His death
took place in 1677. The Oxford historian, who had little reverence for
new lights, and never loses an opportunity of girding at those whose
weights and measures were not according to the current and only
authentic standard, has left no very flattering account of his person.
&quot;He was a little crooked man, and of a despicable presence. He was
laughed at by the boys of this University, because, as they said, he
himself looked like a little wizard.&quot; Small as might be his stature,
and questionable the shape in which he appeared, he might still have
taken up the boast of the author of the <i>Religio Medici</i>: &quot;Men that
look upon my outside do err in my altitude, for I am above Atlas's
shoulders.&quot; None but a large-souled and kindly-affectioned man, whose
intellect was as comprehensive as his feelings were benevolent, could
have produced the excellent little treatise which claims him as its
author. The following is the lofty and memorable peroration in which
he sums up the strength of his cause:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot think without trembling and horror on the vast numbers of
people that in several ages and several countries have been sacrificed
unto this idol, Opinion. Thousands, ten thousands, are upon record to
have been slain, and many of them not with simple deaths, but horrid,
exquisite tortures. And yet, how many are there more who have
undergone the same fate, of whom we have no memorial extant. Since,
therefore, the opinion of witchcraft is a mere stranger unto
Scripture, and wholly alien from true religion; since it is ridiculous
by asserting fables and impossibilities; since it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span> appears, when duly
considered, to be all bloody and full of dangerous consequence unto
the lives and safety of men; I hope that with this my Discourse,
opposing an absurd and pernicious error, I can not at all disoblige
any sober, unbiassed person; especially if he be of such ingenuity as
to have freed himself from a slavish subjection unto those prejudicial
opinions which custom and education do with too much tyranny
impose.&#8212;If the doctrine of witchcraft should be carried up to a
height, and the inquisition after it should be intrusted in the hands
of ambitious, covetous and malicious men, it would prove of far more
fatal consequence unto the lives and safety of mankind, than that
ancient, heathenish custom of sacrificing men unto idol gods; insomuch
that we stand in need of another Hercules Liberator, who, as the
former freed the world from human sacrifice, should, in like manner,
travel from country to country, and by his all-commanding authority,
free it from <i>this euil and base custom of torturing people to confess
themselves witches, and burning them after extorted confessions</i>.
Surely the blood of men ought not to be so cheap, nor so easily to be
shed by those who, under the name of God, do gratifie exorbitant
passions and selfish ends; for without question, under this side
heaven, there is nothing so sacred as the life of man; for the
preservation whereof all policies and forms of government, all laws
and magistrates are most especially ordained. Wherefore I presume that
this Discourse of mine, attempting to prove the vanity and
impossibility of witchcraft, is so far from any deserved censure and
blame, that it rather deserves commendation and praise, if I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span> in
the least measure contribute to the saving of the lives of men.&quot;</p>

<p>Wagstaffe was answered by Meric Casaubon in his treatise &quot;Of Credulity
and Incredulity in Things Divine and Spiritual,&quot; 1670, 12mo; and if
his reply be altogether inconclusive, it cannot be denied to be, as
indeed every thing of Meric Casaubon's writing was, learned,
discursive and entertaining. He observes of Wagstaffe:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;He doth make some show of a scholar and a man of some learning, but
whether he doth acquit himself as a gentleman (which I hear he is) in
it, I shall leave to others to judge.&quot; This is surely the first time
that a belief in witchcraft was ever made a test of gentlemanly
propriety.</p>

<p>Two years before the trial, which is the subject of the following
republication, took place, the hamlet of Thornton, in the parish of
Coxwold, in the adjoining county of York, gave birth to one who was
destined so utterly to demolish the unstable and already shaken and
tottering structure which Bodin, Delrio, and their followers had set
up, as not to leave one stone of that unhallowed edifice remaining
upon another. Of the various course of life of John Webster, the
author of &quot;The Displaying of supposed Witchcraft,&quot; his travels,
troubles, and persecutions; of the experience he had had in restless
youth and in unsettled manhood of religion under various forms,
amongst religionists of almost every denomination; and of those
profound and wide-ranging researches in every art and science in which
his vigorous intellect delighted, and by which it was in declining age
enlightened, sobered and composed; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> much to be regretted that we
have not his own narrative, written in the calm evening of his days,
when he walked the slopes of Pendle, from where,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Rose Clid'row's castle grey;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when, to use his own expressions, he lived a &quot;solitary and sedentary
life, <i>mihi et musis</i>, having more converse with the dead than the
living, that is, more with books than with men.&quot; The facts for his
biography are scanty and meagre, and are rather collected by inference
from his works, than from any other source. He was born at Thornton on
the 3rd of February, 1610. From a passing notice of A. &#224; Wood, and an
incidental allusion in his own works, he may be presumed to have
passed some time at Cambridge, though with what views, or at what
period of his life, is uncertain. He was ordained Presbyter by Dr.
Morton, when Bishop of Durham, who was, it will be recollected, the
sagacious prelate by whom the frauds of the boy of Bilson were
detected. In the year 1634, Webster was curate of Kildwick in Craven,
and while in that cure the scene occurred which he has so vividly
sketched in the passage after quoted, and which supplied the hint, and
laid the foundation, for the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span> which has perpetuated his fame. How
long he continued in this cure we know not: but, if one authority may
be relied on, he was Master of the Free Grammar School at Clitheroe in
1643. To this foundation he may be considered as a great benefactor,
for, from information supplied from a manuscript source, I find that
he recovered for its use, with considerable trouble and no small
personal charge, an income of about &#163;60. per annum, which had been
given to the school, but was illegally diverted and withheld. From
this period there is a blank in his biography for about ten years.
Most probably his life was rambling and desultory. He speaks of
himself as having been about that time a chaplain in the army. His
first two works, published in 1653 and 1654, &quot;The Saints' Guide,&quot; and
&quot;The Judgment Set and the Books Opened,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span> show that in the
interval he had deserted the Established Church, and, probably, after
some of those restless fluctuations of belief to which men of his
ardent temperament are subject, settled at last in a wilder sort of
Independency, which he eulogizes as &quot;unmanacling the simple and pure
light of the Gospel from the chains and fetters of cold and dead
formality, and of restrictive and compulsory power.&quot; His language in
these two works is more assimilated to that of the Seekers or Quakers,
which it resembles in the cloudy mysteriousness of its phraseology,
than that of the more rational and sober writers of the Independent
school. Amongst the dregs of fanaticism of which they consist, the
reader will look in vain for any germ or promise of future excellence
or distinction as an author. It would seem that he preached the
sermons contained in &quot;The Judgment Set and Books Opened&quot; at the church
of All-Hallows, Lombard-street, at which he must have been for some
time the officiating minister, and where the amusing incident, in
which Webster was concerned, narrated by Wood, which had many a
parallel in those times, no doubt occurred. &quot;On the 12th of Oct.,
1653,&quot; says the author of the <i>Athen&#230;.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> &quot;he (<i>i.e.</i> William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
Erbury) with John Webster, sometimes a Cambridge scholar, endeavoured
to knock down learning and the ministry both together, in a
disputation that they then had against two ministers in a church in
Lombard-street, in London. Erbury then declared that the wisest
ministers and purest churches were at that time befool'd, confounded,
and defil'd, by reason of learning. Another while he said, that the
ministry were monsters, beasts, asses, greedy dogs, false prophets;
and that they are the Beast with seven heads and ten horns. The same
person also spoke out and said that Babylon is the Church in her
ministers, and that the Great Whore is the Church in her worship, &amp;c.;
so that with him there was an end of ministers and churches and
ordinations altogether. While these things were babbled to and fro,
the multitude being of various opinions, began to mutter, and many to
cry out, and immediately it came to a meeting or tumult, (call it
which you please,) <i>wherein the women bore away the Bell, but lost
some of them their kerchiefs</i>: and the dispute being hot, there was
more danger of pulling down the church than the ministry.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Of Erbury who, being originally in holy orders and a beneficed
clergyman, deserted the Established Church and ran into all the
excesses of Antinomianism, Webster was a great admirer, and has in a
preface, hitherto unnoticed, prefixed to a scarce tract of Erbury's,
entitled &quot;The great Earthquake, or Fall of all the Churches,&quot;
published in 1654, 4to, left a sketch of his opinions and character,
in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span> his defence is undertaken with great zeal and no small
ingenuity. One of his apologist's conclusions most of Erbury's readers
will find no difficulty in assenting to, &quot;the world is not ripe for
such discoveries as our author held forth.&quot; The verses which are
appended to this sketch, characterizing Erbury&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Who did the saintship sever<br /></span>

<p>are, also, evidently Webster's, and their quality is not such as to
make us unreasonably impatient for any further manifestations of his
poetical skill. In the year 1654 he published another tract of
singular interest and curiosity, in which he attacks the Universities
and the received system of education there, always with vigour and
various learning, and frequently with success. It is entitled
&quot;Academiarum Examen, or the Examination of Academies; wherein is
discussed and examined the matter, method, and customes of academick
and scholastic learning, and the insufficiency thereof discovered and
laid open; as also some expedients proposed for the reforming of
schools, and the perfecting and promoting of all kind of science;
offered to the judgment of all those that love the proficiencie of
arts and sciences and the advancement of learning. By Jo. Webster. In
moribus et institutis academiarum, collegiorum et similium conventium
quo ad doctorum hominum sedes et operas mutuas destinata sunt, omnia
progressui scientiarum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> in ulterius adversa inveniri. Franc. Bacon de
Verulamio lib. de cogitat. et vis. pag. mihi. 14. London: Printed for
Giles Calvert, and are to be sold at the sign of the Black
Spread-Eagle, at the west end of Paul's. 1654.&quot; 4to. In this tract,
which, like some other attacks upon the seats of learning, displays
more power in objection than in substitution, in pulling down than in
building up again, he shews the same fondness for the philosophers of
the Hermetic school, for Paracelsus, Dee, Fludd and Van Helmont, and
the same adhesion to planetary sigils, astrology, and the doctrine of
sympathies and prim&#230;val signatures, which is perceptible in the
deliberate performance of his old age. Of himself he observes: &quot;I owe
little to the advantages of those things called the goods of fortune,
but most (next under the goodness of God) to industry: however, I am a
free born Englishman, a citizen of the world and a seeker of
knowledge, and am willing to teach what I know, and learn what I know
not.&quot; No one can read the <i>Academiarum Examen</i> without feeling that it
is the production of a vigorous and powerful mind, which had &quot;tasted,&quot;
and that not scantily, of the &quot;sweet fruit of far fetched and dear
bought science.&quot; Yet it still remains a literary problem rather
difficult of solution, how a performance so clear, well digested, and
rational, could proceed, and that contemporaneously, from the same
author as the cloudy and fanatical &quot;Judgment Set and Books Opened.&quot; On
behalf of the Universities, answerers started up in the persons of
Ward and Wilkins, both afterwards bishops, and the part taken by the
first of them in the controversy was considered of sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
importance to form matter of commemoration in his monumental
inscription. Two opponents so famous, might almost seem to threaten
extinction to one, of whom it could only be said, that he had been an
obscure country schoolmaster, and whose acquirements, whatever they
were, were mainly the result of his own unassisted study. In the joint
answer, the title of which is &quot;Vindici&#230; Academiarum, containing some
briefe animadversions upon Mr. Webster's book entitled the
'Examination of Academies,' together with an appendix concerning what
Mr. Hobbes and Mr. Dell have published in this argument, Oxford,
1654,&quot; 4to., there is no want of bitterness nor of controversial
skill, but though, particularly in the limited arena of the prescribed
course of academical study, the knowledge displayed in it is more
exact, there is neither visible in it the same power of mind, nor the
same breadth of views, nor even the same variety of learning, as is
conspicuous in the original tract. This, with the two fanatical pieces
which Webster published contemporaneously with it, were entirely
unknown to his biographer, Dr. Whitaker, who has ceded him a place
amongst the distinguished natives and residents of the parish of
Whalley, in the full confidence &quot;that there is no puritanical taint in
his writings, and that his taste had evidently been formed upon better
models.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&quot; Had these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span> early theological and literary delinquencies
of the physician of Clitheroe been communicated to his historian, it
may be questioned whether the portals of his provincial temple of fame
would have opened to receive so heinous a transgressor. But Dr.
Whitaker's deduction would have been perhaps perfectly warrantable,
had Webster left no remains but his <i>History of Metals</i>, and
<i>Displaying of Witchcraft</i>&#8212;so little do an author's latest works
afford a clue to the character of his earliest. From 1654 to 1671,
when he published his <i>History of Metals</i>, little is known of
Webster's course of life. He appears to have retired into the country
and devoted himself to medical practice and study, and to have taken
up his residence in or near Clitheroe. He complains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span> that in the year
1658 all his books and papers were taken from him, an abstraction
which, so far as his manuscripts are concerned, posterity is not
called upon to lament, if they all resembled his <i>Judgment Set and
Books Opened</i>. But his capacious and acute understanding was gradually
unfolding new resources, supplying the defects, and overcoming the
disadvantages of his imperfect education and desultory and irregular
studies, while his matured and enlightened judgment had abandoned and
discarded the fanatical pravities and erroneous tenets, which his
ardent enthusiasm had too hastily imbibed. When he again became a
candidate for the honours of authorship, it was evident that he knew
well how to apply those quarries of learning into which, during his
long recess, he had been digging so indefatigably, to furnish
materials for solid and durable structures, rising in honourable and
gratifying contrast to the fabrics which had preceded them. In 1671
came forth his &quot;Metallographia, or History of Metals,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in which
all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span> that recondite learning and extensive observation could bring
together, on a subject which experiment had scarcely yet placed upon a
rational basis, is collected. He styles himself on the Title page,
&quot;Practitioner in Physic and Chirurgery.&quot; In 1677, he published his
great work. Its Title is &quot;The Displaying of supposed Witchcraft.
Wherein is affirmed that there are many sorts of Deceivers and
Impostors. And Divers persons under a passive Delusion of Melancholy
and Fancy. But that there is a Corporeal League made betwixt the Devil
and the Witch, Or that he sucks on the Witches Body, has Carnal
Copulation, or that Witches are turned into Cats, Dogs, raise
Tempests, or the like, is utterly denied and disproved. Wherein also
is handled, the Existence of Angels and Spirits, the truth of
Apparitions, the Nature of Astral and Sydereal Spirits, the force of
Charms and Philters; with other abstruse matters. By John Webster,

whom he strongly resembled in the character of his mind, in the
complexion and variety of his studies, in grave simplicity, in
exactness of observation, in general philosophical incredulity with
some startling reserves, in elaborate and massive ratiocination, and
in the enthusiasm, subdued but not extinguished, which gives zest to
his speculations and poignancy and colouring to his style. He who
seeks to measure great men in their strength and in their weakness,
and what operation of literary analysis is more instructive or
delightful, will find ample employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span> for collation and comparison
in this extraordinary book, in which, keen as is the penetration
displayed on almost every subject of imposition and delusion, he
appears still to cling, with the obstinacy of a veteran, to some of
the darling Dalilahs of his youth, &quot;to the admirable and
soul-ravishing knowledge of the three great Hypostatical principles of
nature, salt, sulphur, and mercury,&quot; and, <i>proh pudor!</i> to alchemy and
astrology&#8212;and those seraphic doctors and professors, Crollius,
Libavius, and Van Helmont. He closed his literary performances with
this noble fabric of logic and learning, not the less striking, and
scarcely less useful, because it is chequered by some of the mosaic
work of human imperfection,&#8212;a performance which may be said to have
grown up under the umbrage of Pendle, and which he might have
bequeathed to its future Demdikes and Chattox's as an amulet of
irresistible power.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is necessary to proceed from the authors on witchcraft to that
extraordinary case which forms the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span> the present
republication, and which first gave to Pendle its title to be
considered as the Hartz Forest of England.</p>

<p>The Forest of Pendle is a portion of the greater one of
Blackburnshire, and is so called from the celebrated mountain of that
name, over the declivity of which it extends and stretches in a long
but interrupted descent of five miles, to the water of Pendle, a
barren and dreary tract. Dr. Whitaker observes of this and the
neighbouring forests, and the remark even yet holds good, &quot;that they
still bear the marks of original barrenness, and recent cultivation;
that they are still distinguished from the ancient freehold tracts
around them, by want of old houses, old woods, high fences; (for these
were forbidden by the forest laws;) by peculiarities of dialect and
manners in their inhabitants; and lastly, by a general air of poverty
which all the opulence of manufactures cannot remove.&quot; He considers
that &quot;at an uncertain period during the occupancy of the Lacies, the
first principle of population&quot; (in these forests) commenced; it was
found that these wilds, bleak and barren as they were, might be
occupied to some advantage in breeding young and depasturing lean
&quot;cattle, which were afterwards fattened in the lower domains.
<i>Vaccaries</i>, or great upland pastures, were laid out for this purpose;
<i>booths</i> or mansions erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span> upon them for the residence of herdsmen;
and at the same time that herds of deer were permitted to range at
large as heretofore, <i>lawnds</i>, by which are meant parks within a
forest, were inclosed, in order to chase them with greater facility,
or, by confinement, to produce fatter venison. Of these lawnds Pendle
had new and old lawnd, with the contiguous park of Ightenhill.&quot;</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century, the inhabitants of this
district must have been, with few exceptions, a wretchedly poor and
uncultivated race, having little communication with the occupants of
the more fertile regions around them, and in whose minds superstition,
even yet unextinguished, must have had absolute and uncontrollable
domination. Under the disenchanting influence of steam, manufactures,
and projected rail-roads, still much of the old character of its
population remains. <i>Hodie manent vestigia ruris.</i> The &quot;parting
genius&quot; of superstition still clings to the hoary hill tops and rugged
slopes and mossy water sides, along which the old forest stretched its
length, and the voices of ancestral tradition are still heard to speak
from the depth of its quiet hollows, and along the course of its
gurgling streams. He who visits Pendle<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> will yet find that charms
are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span> resorted to amongst the lower classes; that there are
hares which, in their persuasion, never can be caught, and which
survive only to baffle and confound the huntsman; that each small
hamlet has its peculiar and gifted personage, whom it is dangerous to
offend; that the wise man and wise woman (the white witches of our
ancestors) still continue their investigations of truth, undisturbed
by the rural police or the progress of the schoolmaster; that each
locality has its haunted house; that apparitions still walk their
ghostly rounds&#8212;and little would his reputation for piety avail that
clergyman in the eyes of his parishioners who should refuse to lay
those &quot;extravagant and erring spirits,&quot; when requested, by those due
liturgic ceremonies which the orthodoxy of tradition requires.</p>

<p>In the early part of the reign of James the first, and at the period
when his execrable statute against witchcraft might have been
sharpening its appetite by a temporary fast for the full meal of blood
by which it was eventually glutted,&#8212;for as yet it could count no
recorded victims,&#8212;two wretched old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span> women with their families resided
in the Forest of Pendle. Their names were Elizabeth Southernes and Ann
Whittle, better known, perhaps, in the chronicles of witchcraft, by
the appellations of Old Demdike and Old Chattox.<a name="FNanchor_32_35" id="FNanchor_32_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Both had
attained, or had reached the verge of the advanced age of eighty, were
evidently in a state of extreme poverty, subsisting with their
families by occasional employment, by mendicancy, but principally,
perhaps, by the assumption of that unlawful power, which commerce with
spirits of evil was supposed to procure, and of which their sex, life,
appearance, and peculiarities, might seem to the prejudiced
neighbourhood in the Forest to render them not unsuitable
depositaries. In both, perhaps, some vindictive wish, which appeared
to have been gratified nearly as soon as uttered, or some one of those
curious coincidences which no individual's life is without, led to an
impression which time, habit, and general recognition would gradually
deepen into full conviction, that each really possessed the powers
which witchcraft was believed to confer. Whether it be with witches as
it is said to be with a much maligned branch of a certain profession,
that it needs two of its members in a district to make its exercise
profitable, it is not for me to say; but it is seldom found that
competition is accompanied by any very amicable feeling in the
competitors, or by a disposition to underrate the value of the
merchandize which each has to offer for sale. Accordingly, great was
the rivalry, constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span> the feuds, and unintermitting the respective
criminations of the Erictho and Canidia of Pendle,<a name="FNanchor_33_36" id="FNanchor_33_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_36" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> who had opened
shops for the vending of similar contraband commodities, and were
called upon to decry each other's stock, as well as to magnify their
own. Each &quot;gave her little senate laws,&quot; and had her own party (or
tail, according to modern phraseology) in the Forest. Some looked up
to and patronized one, and some the other. If old Demdike could boast
that she had Tibb as a familiar, old Chattox was not without her
Fancy. If the former had skill in waxen images, the latter could dig
up the scalps of the dead, and make their teeth serviceable to her
unhallowed purposes. In the anxiety which each felt to outvie the
other, and to secure the greater share of the general custom of a not
very extended or very lucrative market, each would wish to be
represented as more death-dealing, destructive, and powerful than her
neighbour; and she who could number up the most goodly assortment of
damage done to man and beast, whether real or not was quite
immaterial, as long as the draught was spiced and flavoured to suit
the general taste, stood the best chance of obtaining a monopoly. It
is a curious fact, that the son-in-law of one of these two
individuals, and whose wife was herself executed as a witch, paid to
the other a yearly rent,<a name="FNanchor_34_37" id="FNanchor_34_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_37" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> on an express covenant that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span> should
exempt him from her charms and witchcrafts. Where the possession of a
commission from the powers of darkness was thus eagerly and
ostentatiously paraded, every death, the cause of which was not
perfectly obvious, whether it ended in a sudden termination or a slow
and gradual decline, would be placed to the general account of one of
the two (to use Master Potts's description,) &quot;agents for the devil in
those parts,&quot; as the party responsible for these unclaimed dividends
of mortality. Did a cow go mad, or was a horse unaccountably afflicted
with the staggers, the same solution was always at hand to clear
negligence and save the trouble of inquiry; and so far from modestly
disclaiming these atrocities, the only struggle on the parts of
Mothers Demdike and Chattox would be which should first appropriate
them. And in all this it must not be forgotten that their own
credulity was at least as great as the credulity of their neighbours,
and that each had the power in question was so much an admitted point,
that she had long ceased, in all probability, to entertain any doubts
on the subject. With this general conviction on one hand, and a
sincere persuasion on the other, it would be surprising if, in the
course of a few years, the scandalous chronicle of Pendle had not
accumulated a <i>corpus delicti</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span> against them, which only required that
&quot;<i>one of his Majesties Justices in these parts, a very religious
honest gentleman, painful in the service of his country</i>,&quot; should work
the materials into shape, and make &quot;the gruel thick and slab.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a man was soon found in the representative of the old family of
the Nowels of Read, who, desirous of signalizing himself as an active
and stirring justice, took up the case of these self-accusing
culprits, for both made confessions when examined before him, with a
vigour worthy of a better cause. On the 2nd April, 1612, he committed
old Demdike, old Chattox, Alizon Device, and Anne Redfern to
Lancaster, to take their trial at the next assizes for various murders
and witchcrafts. &quot;Here,&quot; says the faithful chronicler, Master Potts,
&quot;they had not stayed a weeke, when their children and friendes being
abroad at libertie, laboured a speciall meeting at Malking Tower<a name="FNanchor_35_38" id="FNanchor_35_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_38" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span> Forrest of Pendle, vpon Good-fryday, within a weeke after they
were committed, of all the most dangerous, wicked, and damnable
witches in the county farre and neere. Vpon Good-fryday they met,
according to solemne appoyntment, solemnized this great festiuall day
according to their former order, with great cheare, merry company, and
much conference. In the end, in this great assemblie it was decreed
that M. Covell, [he was the gaoler of Lancaster Castle,] by reason of
his Office, shall be slaine before the next Assises, the Castle at
Lancaster to be blown up,&quot; &amp;c., &amp;c. This witches' convention, so
historically famous, we unquestionably owe to the &quot;painful justice&quot;
whose scent after witches and plots entitled him to a promotion which
he did not obtain. An overt act so alarming and so indisputable, at
once threw the country, far and near, into the greatest
ferment&#8212;<i>furiis surrexit Etruria justis</i>&#8212;while it supplied an
admirable <i>locus in quo</i> for tracing those whose retiring habits had
prevented their propensities to witchcraft from being generally known
to their intimate friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span> and connexions. The witness by whose
evidence this legend was principally supported, was Jennet Device, a
child about nine years old, and grand-daughter of old Demdike. A more
dangerous tool in the hands of an unscrupulous evidence-compeller,
being at once intelligent, cunning and pliant, than the child proved
herself, it would not have been easy to have discovered. A foundation
being now laid capable of embracing any body of confederates, the
indefatigable justice proceeded in his inquiries, and in the end,
Elizabeth Device the daughter of old Demdike, James Device her son,
Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, with some
others, were committed for trial at Lancaster. The very curious report
of that trial is contained in the work now republished, which was
compiled under the superintendence of the judges who presided, by
Master Thomas Potts, clerk in court, and present at the trial. His
report, notwithstanding its prolixity and its many repetitions, it has
been thought advisable to publish entire, and the <a href="#DISCOVERIE">reprint</a> which
follows is as near a fac-simile as possible of the original tract.</p>

<p>It is rather strange that Dr. Whitaker, to whom local superstitions
were always matters of the strongest interest, and welcome as manna to
the sojourners in the wilderness,<a name="FNanchor_36_39" id="FNanchor_36_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span> should have been ignorant, not
merely of Master Potts's discovery, but even of the fact of this trial
of the witches in 1612. It is equally singular that Sir Walter Scott
should have forgotten, when writing his letters on Demonology and
Witchcraft, that he had republished this tract, somewhat inaccurately,
but with rather a long introduction and notes, in the third volume of
his edition of the Somers Tracts, which appeared in 1810. He mentions
Potts's <i>Discoverie</i>, in the amusing but very inaccurate and imperfect
historical sketch referred to,<a name="FNanchor_37_40" id="FNanchor_37_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_40" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> as a curious and rare book, which
he had then for the first time obtained a sight of. What could have
been his meaning in referring his readers, for an account of Mother
Demdike and a description of Malking Tower, to &quot;Mr. Roby's Antiquities
of Lancaster,&quot; that apocryphal historian having given no such account
or description, and having published no such work, it is rather
difficult to conjecture.</p>

<p>With all his habitual tautology and grave absurdity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span> Master Potts is,
nevertheless, a faithful and accurate chronicler, and we owe his
memory somewhat for furnishing us with so elaborate a report of what
took place on this trial, and giving us, &quot;in their own country terms,&quot;
the examinations of the witnesses, which contain much which throws
light on the manners and language of the times, and nearly all that is
necessary to enable us to form a judgment on the proceedings. It will
be observed that he follows with great exactness the course pursued in
court, in opening the case and recapitulating the evidence separately
against each prisoner, so as most graphically to place before us the
whole scene as it occurred. The part in which he is felt to be most
deficient, is in the want of some further account of the prisoners
convicted, from the trial up to the time of their execution. To Master
Potts, a man of legal forms and ceremonies, the entire interest in the
case seems to have come in and gone out with the judge's trumpets.</p>

<p>As most of the points in the trial which appeared to require
observation, have been adverted to in the <a href="#NOTES">notes</a> which follow the
<a href="#DISCOVERIE">reprint</a>, it is not considered necessary to enter into any analysis or
review of the evidence adduced at the trial, which presents such a
miserable mockery of justice. Mother Demdike, it will be seen, died in
prison before the trial came on. Of the Pendle witches four, namely
Old Chattox, Elizabeth Device, James Device, and Alizon Device, had
all made confessions, and had little chance, therefore, of escaping
condemnation. They were all found guilty; and with them were
convicted, Anne Redfern, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John
Bulcock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span> and Jane Bulcock, who were all of Pendle or its
neighbourhood, and who maintained their innocence and refused to make
any confession. They were executed, along with the first-mentioned
four and Isabel Robey, who was of Windle, in the parish of Prescot,
and had been found guilty of similar practises, the day after the
trial, viz. on the 18th of August, 1612, &quot;at the common place of
execution near to Lancaster.&quot;</p>

<p>The main interest in reviewing this miserable band of victims will be
felt to centre in Alice Nutter.<a name="FNanchor_38_41" id="FNanchor_38_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_41" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Wealthy, well conducted, well
connected, and placed probably on an equality with most of the
neighbouring families and the magistrate before whom she was brought,
and by whom she was committed, she deserves to be distinguished from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
the companions with whom she suffered, and to attract an attention
which has never yet been directed towards her.<a name="FNanchor_39_42" id="FNanchor_39_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_42" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> That Jennet Device,
on whose evidence she was convicted, was instructed to accuse her by
her own nearest relatives, to whom &quot;superfluous lagged the veteran on
the stage,&quot; and that the magistrate, Roger Nowell, entered actively as
a confederate into the conspiracy from a grudge entertained against
her on account of a long disputed boundary, are allegations which
tradition has preserved, but the truth or falsehood of which, at this
distance of time, it is scarcely possible satisfactorily to examine.
With such a witness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span> however, as Jennet Device, and such an admirable
engine as the meeting at Malking-Tower, the guests at which she could
multiply <i>ad libitum</i>, doling out the <i>plaat</i>, as Titus Oates would
call it, by such instalments, and in such fragmentary portions, as
would conduce to an easy digestion of the whole, the wonder seems not
to be, that one unfortunate victim of a higher class should have
perished in the meshes of artful and complicated villainy, but that
its ramifications were not more extensive, and still more fatal and
destructive. From one so capable of taking a hint as the little
precocious prodigy of wickedness, in whose examination, Potts tells
us, &quot;<i>Mr. Nowell took such great paines</i>,&quot; a very summary deliverance
might be expected from troublesome neighbours, or still more
troublesome relatives; and if, by a leading question, she could only
be induced to marshal them in their allotted places at the witches'
imaginary banquet, there was little doubt of their taking their
station at a place of meeting where the sad realities of life were
only to be encountered, &quot;the common place of execution near to
Lancaster.&quot;</p>

<p>The trial of the Samlesbury witches, Jennet Bierley, Ellen Bierley,
and Jane Southworth, forms a curious episode in Potts's <i>Discoverie</i>.
A Priest or Jesuit, of the name of Thomson, <i>alias</i> Southworth, had
tutored the principal evidence, Grace Sowerbuts, a girl of the age of
fourteen, but who had not the same instinctive genius for perjury as
Jennet Device, to accuse the three persons above mentioned of having
bewitched her; &quot;so that,&quot; as the indictment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span> runs, &quot;by means thereof
her body wasted and consumed.&quot; &quot;The chief object,&quot; says Sir Walter
Scott, &quot;in this imposture, was doubtless the advantage and promotion
of the Catholic cause, as the patient would have been in due time
exorcised and the fiend dispossessed, by the same priest who had
taught her to counterfeit the fits. Revenge against the women, who had
become proselytes to the Church of England, was probably an additional
motive.&quot; But the imposture broke down, from the inability of the
principal witness to support the scheme of deception. Unsuccessful,
however, as it proved, the time was well chosen, the groundwork
excellently laid, the evidence industriously got up, and it must ever
deserve a prominent place in the history&#8212;a history, how delightful
when it shall be written in the spirit of philosophy and with due
application of research&#8212;of human fraud and imposture.</p>

<p>We can only speculate, of course, on such an occasion, but perhaps no
trial is recorded as having taken place, with the results of which
every body, the parties convicted only excepted, was, in all
probability, better pleased or satisfied, than at this witch trial at
Lancaster in 1612. The mob would be delighted with a pageant, always
acceptable, in the execution of ten witches; and still more, that one
of them was of a rank superior to their own;&#8212;the judge had no doubt,
in his opinion, avoided each horn of the dilemma&#8212;the abomination
mentioned in Scripture&#8212;punishing the innocent or letting the guilty
go free&#8212;by tracking guilt with well breathed sagacity, and
unravelling imposture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span> with unerring skill;&#8212;a Jesuit had been
unkennelled, a spectacle as gratifying to a serious Protestant in
those days, as running down a fox to a thorough sportsman;&#8212;a plot had
been discovered which might have made Lancaster Castle &quot;to topple on
its warders&quot; and &quot;slope its head to its foundations,&quot; and Master
Cowell, who had held so many inquests, to vanish without leaving
anything in his own person whereon an inquest could be holden;&#8212;a
pestilent nest of incorrigible witches had been dug out and rooted up,
and Pendle Hill placed under sanatory regulations;&#8212;and last, and not
least, as affording matter of pride and exultation to every loyal
subject, a commentary had at last been collected for two texts, which
had long called for some such support without finding it, King James's
<i>Demonology</i>, and his statute against witchcraft. When the
<i>Discoverie</i> of Master Potts, with its rich treasury of illustrative
evidence, came to hand, would not the monarch be the happiest man in
his dominions!</p>

<p>Twenty years after the publication of the <a href="#DISCOVERIE">tract</a> now reprinted, Pendle
Forest again became the scene of pretended witchcrafts; and from
various circumstances, the trial which took place then (in 1633) has
acquired even greater notoriety than the one which preceded it, though
no Master Potts could be found to transmit a report of the proceedings
in the second case, a deficiency which is greatly to be lamented. The
particulars are substantially comprised in the following examination,
which is given from the copy in Whitaker's <i>Whalley</i>, p. 213, which,
on comparison, is unquestionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span> more accurate than the other two
versions, in Webster, p. 347, and Baines's <i>Lancashire</i>, vol. i. p.

the blacke greyhound, one <i>Dickonson</i> wife stoode up (a neighb<sup>r</sup>.)
whom this informer knoweth, and in steade of the browne greyhound a
little boy whom this informer knoweth not. At which sight this
informer beeinge affraid indevoured to run away: but beeinge stayed by
the woman, viz. by <i>Dickonson's</i> wife, shee put her hand into her
pocket, and pulled out a peace of silver much like to a faire
shillinge, and offered to give him to hould his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span> tongue, and not to
tell, whiche hee refused, sayinge, nay thou art a witch; Whereupon
shee put her hand into her pocket againe, and pulled out a stringe
like unto a bridle<a name="FNanchor_48_51" id="FNanchor_48_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_51" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that gingled, which shee put upon the litle
boyes heade that stood up in the browne greyhounds steade; whereupon
the said boy stood up a white horse. Then immediately the said
<i>Dickonson</i> wife tooke this informer before her upon the said horse,
and carried him to a new house called <i>Hoarestones</i>,<a name="FNanchor_49_52" id="FNanchor_49_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_52" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> beinge about
a quarter of a mile off, whither, when they were comme, there were
divers persons about the doore, and hee sawe divers others cominge
rideinge upon horses of severall colours towards the said house, which
tyed theire horses to a hedge neare to the sed house; and which
persons went into the sed house, to the number of threescore or
thereabouts, as this informer thinketh, where they had a fyer and
meate roastinge, and some other meate stirringe in the house, whereof
a yonge woman whom hee this informer knoweth not, gave him flesh and
breade upon a trencher, and drinke in a glasse, which, after the first
taste, hee refused, and would have noe more, and said it was nought.
And presently after, seeinge diverse of the company goinge to a barn
neare adioyneinge,<a name="FNanchor_50_53" id="FNanchor_50_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_53" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> hee followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span> after, and there he sawe sixe of
them kneelinge, and pullinge at sixe severall roapes which were
fastened or tyed to ye toppe of the house; at or with which pullinge
came then in this informers sight flesh smoakeinge, butter in lumps,
and milke as it were syleinge<a name="FNanchor_51_54" id="FNanchor_51_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_54" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> from the said roapes, all which fell
into basons whiche were placed under the saide roapes. And after that
these sixe had done, there came other sixe which did likewise, and
duringe all the tyme of theire so pullinge, they made such foule faces
that feared<a name="FNanchor_52_55" id="FNanchor_52_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_55" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> this informer, soe as hee was glad to steale out and
run home, whom, when they wanted, some of theire company came runninge
after him neare to a place in a high way, called Boggard-hole,<a name="FNanchor_53_56" id="FNanchor_53_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_56" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
where this informer met two horsemen, at the sight whereof the sed
persons left followinge him, and the foremost of which persons yt
followed him, hee knoweth to bee one <i>Loynd</i> wife, which said wife,
together with one <i>Dickonson</i> wife, and one <i>Jenet Davies</i><a name="FNanchor_54_57" id="FNanchor_54_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_57" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> he hath
seene at severall tymes in a croft or close adioninge to his fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>
house, whiche put him in a greate feare. And further, this informer
saith, upon Thursday after New Yeares day last past, he sawe the sed
<i>Loynd</i> wife sittinge upon a crosse peece of wood, beeinge within the
chimney of his father's dwellinge house, and hee callinge to her,
said, come downe thou <i>Loynd</i> wife, and immediately the sed <i>Loynd</i>
wife went up out of his sight. And further, this informer saith, yt
after hee was comme from ye company aforesed to his father's house,
beeinge towards eveninge, his father bad him goe fetch home two kyne
to seale,<a name="FNanchor_55_58" id="FNanchor_55_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_58" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and in the way, in a field called the Ollers, hee
chanced to hap upon a boy, who began to quarrell with him, and they
fought soe together till this informer had his eares made very bloody
by fightinge, and lookinge downe, hee sawe the boy had a cloven foote,
at which sight hee was affraid, and ran away from him to seeke the
kyne. And in the way hee sawe a light like a lanthorne, towards which
he made hast, supposinge it to bee carried by some of Mr. <i>Robinson's</i>
people: But when hee came to the place, hee onley found a woman
standinge on a bridge, whom, when hee sawe her, he knewe to bee
<i>Loynd</i> wife, and knowinge her, he turned backe againe, and immediatly
hee met with ye aforesed boy, from whom he offered to run, which boy
gave him a blow on the back which caus'd him to cry. And hee farther
saith, yt when hee was in the barne, he sawe three women take three
pictures from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span> off the beame, in the which pictures many thornes, or

<p>The name of Margaret Johnson does not appear in Edmund Robinson's
examination. Whether accused or not, the opportunity was too alluring
to be lost by a personage full of matter, being like old Mause
Headrigg, &quot;as a bottle that lacketh vent,&quot; and too desirous of
notoriety, to let slip such an occasion. She made, on the 2nd of March
following, before the same justices who had taken Robinson's
examination, the following confession, which must have been considered
a most instructive one by those who were in search of some short <i>vade
mecum</i> of the statistics of witchcraft in Pendle:&#8212;</p>


<p style="text-align: center">&quot;<span class="smcap">The Confession of Margaret Johnson</span>.</p>

<p>&quot;That betwixt seaven and eight yeares since, shee beeinge in her owne
house in <i>Marsden</i>, in a greate passion of anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span> and discontent, and
withall pressed with some want, there appeared unto her a spirit or
devill in ye proportion or similitude of a man, apparrelled in a suite
of blacke, tyed about with silk points, who offered yt if shee would
give him her soule hee would supply all her wants, and bringe to her
whatsoever shee did neede. And at her appointment would in revenge
either kill or hurt whom or what shee desyred, weare it man or beast.
And saith, yt after a solicitation or two shee contracted and
covenanted with ye said devill for her soule. And yt ye said devill or
spirit badde her call him by the name of <i>Mamilian</i>. And when shee
would have him to doe any thinge for her, call in <i>Mamilian</i>, and hee
would bee ready to doe her will. And saith, yt in all her talke or
conference shee calleth her said devill, <i>Mamil</i> my God. Shee further
saith, yt ye said <i>Mamilian</i>, her devill, (by her consent) did abuse
and defile her body by comittinge wicked uncleannesse together. And
saith, yt shee was not at the greate meetings at <i>Hoarestones</i>, at the
forest of <i>Pendle</i>, upon All-Saints Day, where &#8212;&#8212;. But saith yt shee
was at a second meetinge ye Sunday next after All-Saints Day, at the
place aforesaid; where there was at yt tyme between 30 and 40 witches,
who did all ride to the said meetinge, and the end of theire said
meeting was to consult for the killinge and hurtinge of men and
beasts. And yt besides theire particular familiars or spirits, there
was one greate or grand devill or spirit more eminent than the rest.
And if any desyre to have a greate and more wonderfull devill, whereby
they may have more power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[lxxiv]</a></span> hurt, they may have one such. And sayth,
yt such witches as have sharp bones given them by the devill to pricke
them, have no pappes or dugges whereon theire devill may sucke, but
theire devill receiveth bloud from the place, pricked with the bone.
And they are more grand witches than any yt have marks. Shee allsoe
saith, yt if a witch have but one marke, shee hath but one spirit, if
two then two spirits, if three yet but two spirits. And saith, yt
theire spirits usually have knowledge of theire bodies. And being
desyred to name such as shee knewe to be witches, shee named, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_59_63" id="FNanchor_59_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_63" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
And if they would torment a man, they bid theire spirit goe and tormt.
him in any particular place. And yt Good-Friday is one constant day
for a yearely generall meetinge of witches. And yt on Good-Friday
last, they had a meetinge neare <i>Pendle</i> water syde. Shee alsoe saith,
that men witches usually have women spirits, and women witches men
spirits. And theire devill or spirit gives them notice of theire
meetinge, and tells them the place where it must bee. And saith, if
they desyre to be in any place upon a sodaine, theire devill or spirit
will upon a rodde, dogge, or any thinge els, presently convey them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[lxxv]</a></span>
thither: yea, into any roome of a man's house. But shee saith it is
not the substance of theire bodies, but theire spirit assumeth such
form and shape as goe into such roomes. Shee alsoe saith, yt ye devill
(after he begins to sucke) will make a pappe or dugge in a short tyme,
and the matter which hee sucks is blood. And saith yt theire devills
can cause foule weather and storms, and soe did at theire meetings.
Shee alsoe saith yt when her devill did come to sucke her pappe, hee
usually came to her in ye liknes of a cat, sometymes of one colour and
sometymes of an other. And yt since this trouble befell her, her
spirit hath left her, and shee never sawe him since.&quot;</p>

<p>On the evidence contained in these examinations several persons were
committed for trial at Lancaster, and seventeen, on being tried at the
ensuing assizes, were found guilty by the jury. The judge before whom
the trial took place was, however, more sagacious and enlightened than
his predecessors, Bromley and Altham. He respited the execution of the
prisoners; and on the case being reported to the king in council, the
Bishop of Chester, Dr. Bridgman, was required to investigate the
circumstances. The inquiry was instituted at Chester, and four of the
convicted witches, namely, Margaret Johnson, Frances Dickonson, Mary
Spencer, and the wife of one of the Hargreaves's, were sent to London,
and examined, first by the king's physicians and surgeons, and
afterwards by Charles the first in person.</p>

<p>&quot;A stranger scene&quot; to quote Dr. Whitaker's concluding paragraph &quot;can
scarcely be conceived; and it is not easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[lxxvi]</a></span> imagine whether the
untaught manners, rude dialect, and uncouth appearance of these poor
foresters, would more astonish the king; or his dignity of person and
manners, together with the splendid scene with which they were
surrounded, would overwhelm them. The end, however, of the business
was, that strong presumptions appeared of the boy having been suborned
to accuse them falsely, and they were accordingly dismissed. The boy
afterwards confessed that he was suborned.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_60_64" id="FNanchor_60_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_64" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In Dr. Whitaker's astonishment that Margaret Johnson should make the
confession she appears to have done, in a clear case of imposture, few
of his readers will be disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[lxxvii]</a></span> to participate, who are at all
conversant with the trials of reputed witches in this country.
Confessions were so common on those occasions, that there is, I
believe, not a single instance of any great number of persons being
convicted of witchcraft at one time, some of whom did not make a
confession of guilt. Nor is there anything extraordinary in that
circumstance, when it is remembered that many of them sincerely
believed in the existence of the powers attributed to them; and
others, aged and of weak understanding, were, in a measure, coerced by
the strong persuasion of their guilt, which all around them
manifested, into an acquiescence in the truth of the accusation. In
many cases the confessions were made in the hope, and no doubt with
the promise, seldom performed, that a respite from punishment would be
eventually granted. In other instances, there is as little doubt, that
they were the final results of irritation, agony, and despair.<a name="FNanchor_61_65" id="FNanchor_61_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_65" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The
confessions are generally composed of &quot;such stuff as dreams are made
of,&quot; and what they report to have occurred, might either proceed, when
there was no intention to fabricate, from intertwining the fantastic
threads which sometimes stream upon the waking senses from the land of
shadows, or be caused by those ocular hallucinations of which medical
science has supplied full and satisfactory solution. There is no
argument which so long maintained its ground in support of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[lxxviii]</a></span> witchcraft
as that which was founded on the confessions referred to. It was the
last plank clung to by many a witch-believing lawyer and divine. And
yet there is none which will less bear critical scrutiny and
examination, or the fallacy of which can more easily be shown, if any
particular reported confession is taken as a test and subjected to a
searching analysis and inquiry.</p>

<p>It is said that we owe to the grave and saturnine Monarch, who
extended his pardon to the seventeen convicted in 1633, that happy
generalisation of the term, which appropriates honourably to the sex
in Lancashire the designation denoting the fancied crime of a few
miserable victims of superstition. That gentle sex will never
repudiate a title bestowed by one, little given to the playful sports
of fancy, whose sorrows and unhappy fate have never wanted their
commiseration, and who distinguished himself on this memorable
occasion, at a period when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;'twas the time's plague<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That madmen led the blind,&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8212;in days when philosophy stumbled and murder arrayed itself in the
robes of justice&#8212;by an enlightened exercise of the kingly prerogative
of mercy. Proceeding from such a fountain of honour, and purified by
such an appropriation, the title of witch has long lost its original
opprobrium in the County Palatine, and survives only to call forth the
gayest and most delightful associations. In process of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[lxxix]</a></span> even the
term <i>witchfinder</i> may lose the stains which have adhered to it from
the atrocities of Hopkins, and may be adopted by general usage, as a
sort of companion phrase, to signify the fortunate individual, who, by
an union with a Lancashire witch, has just asserted his indefeasible
title to be considered as the happiest of men.</p>

<p>Hough publique iustice hath passed at these Assises vpon the
Capitall offendours, and after the Arraignement &amp; tryall of them,
Iudgement being giuen, due and timely Execution succeeded; which doth
import and giue the greatest satisfaction that can be, to all men; yet
because vpon the caryage, and euent of this businesse, the Eyes of all
the partes of <i>Lancashire</i>, and other Counties in the North partes
thereunto adioyning were bent: And so infinite a multitude came to the
Arraignement &amp; tryall of these Witches at <i>Lancaster</i>, the number of
them being knowen to exceed all others at any time heretofore, at one
time to be indicted, arraigned, and receiue their tryall,<a href="#Ba">[B<i>a</i>]</a>
especially for so many Murders, Conspiracies, Charmes, Meetinges,
hellish and damnable practises, so apparant vpon their owne
examinations &amp; confessions. These my honourable &amp; worthy Lords, the
Iudges of Assise, vpon great consideration, thought it necessarie &amp;
profitable, to publish to the whole world, their most barbarous and
damnable practises, with the direct proceedinges of the Court against
them, aswell for that there doe passe diuers vncertaine reportes and
relations of such Euidences, as was publiquely giuen against them at
their Arraignement. As for that diuers came to prosecute against many
of them that were not found guiltie, and so rest very discontented,
and not satisfied. As also for that it is necessary for men to know
and vnderstande the meanes whereby they worke their mischiefe, the
hidden misteries of their diuelish and wicked Inchauntmentes, Charmes,
and Sorceries, the better to preuent and auoyde the danger that may
ensue. And lastly, who were the principall authors and actors in this
late woefull and lamentable <i>Tragedie</i>, wherein so much Blood was
spilt.</p>

<p>Therefore I pray you giue me leaue, (with your patience and fauour,)
before I proceed to the Indictment, Arraignement, and Tryall of such
as were prisoners in the Castle, to lay open the life and death of
this damnable and malicious Witch, of so long continuance (old
<i>Demdike</i>) of whom our whole businesse hath such dependence, that
without the particular Declaration and Record of her Euidence, with
the circumstaunces, wee shall neuer bring any thing to good
perfection: for from this Sincke of villanie and mischiefe, haue all
the rest proceeded; as you shall haue them in order.</p>

<p>She was a very old woman, about the age of Fourescore<a href="#Bb">[B<i>b</i>]</a> yeares,
and had been a Witch for fiftie yeares. Shee dwelt in the Forrest of
<i>Pendle</i>, a vaste place, fitte for her profession: What shee committed
in her time, no man knowes.</p>

<p>Thus liued shee securely for many yeares, brought vp her owne
Children, instructed her Graund-children, and tooke great care and
paines to bring them to be Witches. Shee was a generall agent for the
Deuill in all these partes: no man escaped her, or her Furies, that
euer gaue them any occasion of offence, or denyed them any thing they
stood need of: And certaine it is, no man neere them, was secure or
free from danger.</p>

<p>But God, who had in his diuine prouidence prouided to cut them off,
and roote them out of the Commonwealth, so disposed aboue, that the
Iustices of those partes, vnderstanding by a generall charme and
muttering, the great and vniuersall resort to <i>Maulking Tower</i>, the
common opinion, with the report of these suspected people, the
complaint of the Kinges subiectes for the losse of their Children,
Friendes, Goodes, and Cattle, (as there could not be so great Fire
without some Smoake,) sent for some of the Countrey, and tooke great
paynes to enquire after their proceedinges, and courses of life.</p>

<p>In the end, <i>Roger Nowell</i> Esquire,<a href="#B2a">[B2<i>a</i>]</a> one of his Maiesties
Iustices in these partes, a very religious honest Gentleman, painefull
in the seruice of his Countrey: whose fame for this great seruice to
his Countrey, shall liue after him, tooke vpon him to enter into the
particular examination of these suspected persons: And to the honour
of God, and the great comfort of all his Countrey, made such a

</p>

<p><img src="images/image11.png" alt="T" width="126" height="125" class="floatl" /></p>

<p>He said <i>Elizabeth Sowtherns</i> confesseth, and sayth; That about
twentie yeares past, as she was comming homeward from begging, there
met her this Examinate neere vnto a Stonepit in <i>Gouldshey</i>,<a href="#B2b1">[B2<i>b</i>1]</a>
in the sayd Forrest of <i>Pendle</i>, a Spirit or Deuill in the shape of a
Boy, the one halfe of his Coate blacke, and the other browne, who bade
this Examinate stay, saying to her, that if she would giue him her
Soule, she should haue any thing that she would request. Wherevpon
this Examinat demaunded his name? and the Spirit answered, his name
was <i>Tibb</i>:<a href="#B2b2">[B2<i>b</i>2]</a> and so this Examinate in hope of such gaine as was
promised by the sayd Deuill or <i>Tibb</i>, was contented to giue her Soule
to the said Spirit: And for the space of fiue or sixe yeares next
after, the sayd Spirit or Deuill appeared at sundry times vnto her
this Examinate about <i>Day-light</i> Gate,<a href="#B2b3">[B2<i>b</i>3]</a> alwayes bidding her
stay, and asking her this Examinate what she would haue or doe? To
whom this Examinate replyed, Nay nothing: for she this Examinate said,
she wanted nothing yet. And so about the end of the said sixe yeares,
vpon a Sabboth day in the morning, this Examinate hauing a litle Child
vpon her knee, and she being in a slumber, the sayd Spirit appeared
vnto her in the likenes of a browne Dogg, forcing himselfe to her
knee, to get blood vnder her left Arme: and she being without any
apparrell sauing her Smocke, the said Deuill did get blood vnder her
left arme.<a href="#B3a1">[B3<i>a</i>1]</a> And this Examinate awaking, sayd, <i>Iesus saue my
Child</i>; but had no power, nor could not say, <i>Iesus saue her selfe</i>:
wherevpon the Browne Dogge vanished out of this Examinats sight: after
which, this Examinate was almost starke madd for the space of eight
weekes.</p>

<p>And vpon her examination, she further confesseth, and saith. That a
little before Christmas last, this Examinates Daughter hauing been to
helpe <i>Richard Baldwyns</i> Folkes at the Mill: This Examinates Daughter
did bid her this Examinate goe to the sayd <i>Baldwyns</i> house, and aske
him some thing for her helping of his Folkes at the Mill, (as
aforesaid:) and in this Examinates going to the said <i>Baldwyns</i> house,
and neere to the sayd house, she mette with the said <i>Richard
Baldwyn</i>; Which <i>Baldwyn</i> sayd to this Examinate, and the said <i>Alizon
Deuice</i><a href="#B3a3">[B3<i>a</i>3]</a> (who at that time ledde this Examinate, being blinde)
get out of my ground Whores and Witches, I will burne the one of you,
and hang the other.<a href="#B3a2">[B3<i>a</i>2]</a> To whom this Examinate answered: I care
not for thee, hang thy selfe: Presently wherevpon, at this Examinates
going ouer the next hedge, the said Spirit or Diuell called <i>Tibb</i>,
appeared vnto this Examinat, and sayd, <i>Reuenge thee of him</i>. To whom,
this Examinate sayd againe to the said Spirit. <i>Revenge thee eyther of
him, or his.</i> And so the said Spirit vanished out of her sight, and
she neuer saw him since.</p>

<p>And further this Examinate confesseth, and sayth, that the speediest
way to take a mans life away by Witchcraft, is to make a Picture of
Clay,<a href="#B3b">[B3<i>b</i>]</a> like vnto the shape of the person whom they meane to
kill, &amp; dry it thorowly: and when they would haue them to be ill in
any one place more then an other; then take a Thorne or Pinne, and
pricke it in that part of the Picture you would so haue to be ill: and
when you would haue any part of the Body to consume away, then take
that part of the Picture, and burne it. And when they would haue the
whole body to consume away, then take the remnant of the sayd Picture,
and burne it: and so therevpon by that meanes, the body shall die.</p>

<p>Irst, the sayd <i>Anne Whittle</i>, alias <i>Chattox</i>, sayth, that about
foureteene yeares past she entered, through the wicked perswasions and
counsell of <i>Elizabeth Southerns</i>, alias <i>Demdike</i>, and was seduced to
condescend &amp; agree to become subiect vnto that diuelish abhominable
profession of Witchcraft: Soone after which, the Deuill appeared vnto
her in the liknes of a Man, about midnight, at the house of the sayd
<i>Demdike</i>: and therevpon the sayd <i>Demdike</i> and shee, went foorth of
the said house vnto him; wherevpon the said wicked Spirit mooued this
Examinate, that she would become his Subiect, and giue her Soule vnto
him: the which at first, she refused to assent vnto; but after, by the
great perswasions made by the sayd <i>Demdike</i>, shee yeelded to be at
his commaundement and appoyntment: wherevpon the sayd wicked Spirit
then sayd vnto her, that hee must haue one part of her body for him to
sucke vpon; the which shee denyed then to graunt vnto him; and withall
asked him, what part of her body hee would haue for that vse; who
said, hee would haue a place of her right side neere to her ribbes,
for him to sucke vpon: whereunto shee assented.</p>

<p>And she further sayth, that at the same time, there was a thing in the
likenes of a spotted Bitch, that came with the sayd Spirit vnto the
sayd <i>Demdike</i>, which then did speake vnto her in this Examinates
hearing, and sayd, that she should haue Gould, Siluer, and worldly
Wealth, at her will.<a href="#B4b1">[B4<i>b</i>1]</a> And at the same time she saith, there was
victuals, <i>viz.</i> Flesh, Butter, Cheese, Bread, and Drinke, and bidde
them eate enough. And after their eating, the Deuill called <i>Fancie</i>,
and the other Spirit calling himselfe <i>Tibbe</i>, carried the remnant
away: And she sayeth, that although they did eate, they were neuer the
fuller, nor better for the same; and that at their said Banquet, the

neyther had fire nor Candle light; and that they were both shee
Spirites, and Diuels.</p>

<i>Elizabeth Sowtherns</i>, alias <i>Demdike</i>, hath had a place on her left
side by the space of fourty yeares, in such sort, as was to be seene
at this Examinates Examination taking, at this present time.</p>

<p>Heere this worthy Iustice M. <i>Nowell</i>, out of these particular
Examinations, or rather Accusations, finding matter to proceed; and
hauing now before him old <i>Demdike</i>, old <i>Chattox</i>, <i>Alizon Deuice</i>,
and <i>Redferne</i> both old and young, <i>Reos confitentes, et Accusantes
Inuicem</i>. About the second of Aprill last past, committed and sent
them away to the Castle at <i>Lancaster</i>, there to remaine vntill the
comming of the Kinges Maiesties Iustices of Assise, then to receiue
their tryall.</p>

<p>But heere they had not stayed a weeke, when their Children and
Friendes being abroad at libertie, laboured a speciall meeting at
<i>Malking Tower</i> in the Forrest of <i>Pendle</i>,<a href="#C3a">[C3<i>a</i>]</a> vpon Good-fryday,
within a weeke after they were committed, of all the most dangerous,
wicked, and damnable Witches in the County farre and neere. Vpon
Good-fryday they met, according to solemne appoyntment, solemnized
this great Feastiuall day according to their former order, with great
cheare, merry company, and much conference.</p>

<p>In the end, in this great Assemblie, it was decreed M. <i>Couell</i> by
reason of his Office, shall be slaine before the next Assises: The
Castle of <i>Lancaster</i> to be blowen vp, and ayde and assistance to be
sent to kill M. <i>Lister</i>, with his old Enemie and wicked Neighbour
<i>Iennet Preston</i>; with some other such like practices: as vpon their
Arraignement and Tryall, are particularly set foorth, and giuen in
euidence against them.</p>

<p>This was not so secret, but some notice of it came to M. <i>Nowell</i>, and
by his great paines taken in the Examination of <i>Iennet Deuice</i>, al
their practises are now made knowen. Their purpose to kill M.
<i>Couell</i>, and blow vp the Castle, is preuented. All their Murders,
Witchcraftes, Inchauntments, Charmes, &amp; Sorceries, are discouered; and
euen in the middest of their consultations, they are all confounded,
and arrested by Gods Iustice: brought before M. <i>Nowell</i>, and M.
<i>Bannester</i>, vpon their voluntary confessions, Examinations, and other
Euidence accused, and so by them committed to the Castle: So as now
both old and young, haue taken vp their lodgings with M. <i>Couell</i>,
vntill the next Assises, expecting their Tryall and deliuerance,
according to the Lawes prouided for such like.</p>

<p>In the meane time, M. <i>Nowell</i> hauing knowledge by this discouery of
their meeting at <i>Malkeing Tower</i>, and their resolution to execute
mischiefe, takes great paines to apprehend such as were at libertie,
and prepared Euidence against all such as were in question for

<p>F in this damnable course of life, and offences, more horrible and
odious, then any man is able to expresse: any man lyuing could lament
the estate of any such like vpon earth: The example of this poore
creature, would haue moued pittie, in respect of her great contrition
and repentance, after she was committed to the Castle at <i>Lancaster</i>,
vntill the comming of his Maiesties Iudges of Assise. But such was the
nature of her offences, &amp; the multitude of her crying sinnes, as it
tooke away all sense of humanity. And the repetition of her hellish
practises, and Reuenge; being the chiefest thinges wherein she alwayes
tooke great delight, togeather with a particular declaration of the
Murders shee had committed, layde open to the world, and giuen in
Euidence against her at the time of her Arraignement and Tryall; as
certainely it did beget contempt in the Audience, and such as she
neuer offended.</p>

<p>This <i>Anne Whittle</i>, alias <i>Chattox</i>, was a very old withered spent
and decreped creature, her sight almost gone: A dangerous Witch, of
very long continuance; alwayes opposite to old <i>Demdike</i>: For whom the
one fauoured, the other hated deadly: <span class="sidenote"><i>Her owne
examination</i></span>and how they enuie and accuse one an other, in their
Examinations, may appeare.</p>

<p>In her Witchcraft, alwayes more ready to doe mischiefe to mens goods,
then themselues. Her lippes euer chattering and walking:<a href="#D2a1">[D2<i>a</i>1]</a> but
no man knew what. She liued in the Forrest of <i>Pendle</i>, amongst this
wicked company of dangerous Witches. Yet in her Examination and
Confession, she dealt alwayes very plainely and truely: for vpon a
speciall occasion being oftentimes examined in open Court, shee was
neuer found to vary, but alwayes to agree in one, and the selfe same
thing.</p>

<p>I place her in order, next to that wicked fire-brand of mischiefe, old
<i>Demdike</i>, because from these two, sprung all the rest in
order:<a href="#D2a2">[D2<i>a</i>2]</a> and were the Children and Friendes, of these two
notorious Witches.</p>

<p>Many thinges in the discouery of them, shall be very worthy your
obseruation. As the times and occasions to execute their mischiefe.
And this in generall: the Spirit could neuer hurt, till they gaue
consent.</p>

<p>And, but that it is my charge, to set foorth a particular Declaration
of the Euidence against them, vpon their Arraignement and Tryall; with
their Diuelish practises, consultations, meetings, and murders
committed by them, in such sort, as they were giuen in Euidence
against them; for the which, I shall haue matter vpon Record. I could
make a large Comentarie of them: But it is my humble duety, to obserue
the Charge and Commaundement of these my Honorable good Lordes the
Iudges of Assise, and not to exceed the limits of my Commission.
Wherefore I shall now bring this auncient Witch, to the due course of
her Tryall, in order. <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>He sayd <i>Anne Whittle</i>, alias <i>Chattox</i>, vpon her Examination,
voluntarily confesseth, and sayth, That about foureteene or fifteene
yeares agoe, a thing like a Christian man for foure yeares togeather,
did sundry times come to this Examinate, and requested this Examinate
to giue him her Soule: And in the end, this Examinate was contented to
giue him her sayd Soule, shee being then in her owne house, in the
Forrest of <i>Pendle</i>; wherevpon the Deuill then in the shape of a Man,
sayd to this Examinate: Thou shalt want nothing; and be reuenged of
whom thou list. And the Deuill then further commaunded this
Examinate, to call him by the name of <i>Fancie</i>;<a href="#D3a">[D3<i>a</i>]</a> and when she
wanted any thing, or would be reuenged of any, call on <i>Fancie</i>, and
he would be ready. And the sayd Spirit or Deuill, did appeare vnto her
not long after, in mans likenesse, and would haue had this Examinate
to haue consented, that he might hurt the wife of <i>Richard Baldwin</i> of
<i>Pendle</i>;<a href="#D3b1">[D3<i>b</i>1]</a> But this Examinate would not then consent vnto him:
For which cause, the sayd Deuill would then haue bitten her by the
arme; and so vanished away, for that time.</p>

<p>And this Examinate further sayth, that <i>Robert Nutter</i><a href="#D3b2">[D3<i>b</i>2]</a> did
desire her Daughter one <i>Redfearns</i> wife, to haue his pleasure of her,
being then in <i>Redfearns</i> house: but the sayd <i>Redfearns</i> wife denyed
the sayd <i>Robert</i>; wherevpon the sayd <i>Robert</i> seeming to be greatly
displeased therewith, in a great anger tooke his Horse, and went away,
saying in a great rage, that if euer the Ground came to him, shee
should neuer dwell vpon his Land. Wherevpon this Examinate called
<i>Fancie</i> to her; who came to her in the likenesse of a Man in a
parcell of Ground called, <i>The Laund</i>; asking this Examinate, what
shee would haue him to doe? And this Examinate bade him goe reuenge
her of the sayd <i>Robert Nutter</i>. After which time, the sayd <i>Robert
Nutter</i> liued about a quarter of a yeare, and then dyed.</p>

<p>And this Examinate further sayth, that <i>Elizabeth Nutter</i>, wife to old
<i>Robert Nutter</i>, did request this Examinate, and <i>Loomeshaws</i> wife of
<i>Burley</i>, and one <i>Iane Boothman</i>, of the same, who are now both dead,
(which time of request, was before that <i>Robert Nutter</i> desired the
company of <i>Redfearns</i> wife) to get young <i>Robert Nutter</i> his death,
if they could; all being togeather then at that time, to that end,
that if <i>Robert</i> were dead, then the Women their Coosens might haue
the Land: By whose perswasion, they all consented vnto it. After which
time, this Examinates Sonne in law <i>Thomas Redfearne</i>, did perswade
this Examinate, not to kill or hurt the sayd <i>Robert Nutter</i>; for
which perswasion, the sayd <i>Loomeshaws</i> Wife, had like to haue killed
the sayd <i>Redfearne</i>, but that one M. <i>Baldwyn</i> (the late
Schoole-maister at <i>Coulne</i>) did by his learning, stay the sayd
<i>Loomeshaws</i> wife, and therefore had a Capon from <i>Redfearne</i>.<a href="#D4a">[D4<i>a</i>]</a></p>

<p>And this Examinate further sayth, that she thinketh the sayd
<i>Loomeshaws</i> wife, and <i>Iane Boothman</i>, did what they could to kill
the sayd <i>Robert Nutter</i>, as well as this Examinate did.</p>

back to helpe them to make the Pictures aforesaid; the said Spirit
seeming to be angrie, therefore shoue or pushed this Examinate into

Kit: and so thereupon the Spirit at that time vanished out of this

to bee Witches. And hee also saith, that about some eighteene yeares

Grand-father, in the Sommer time, he fell sicke, and in his said

the said <i>Robert Nutter</i> shortly after, being to goe with his then
Master, called Sir <i>Richard Shattleworth</i>,<a href="#E2a">[E2<i>a</i>]</a> into Wales, this

the said <i>Redferne</i> out of his house, or he himselfe would pull it
downe; to whom the said <i>Redferne</i> replyed, saying; when you come back
againe you will be in a better minde: but he neuer came back againe,
but died before Candlemas in Cheshire, as he was comming homeward.</p>

<p>And this Examinate further saith, That her father, called <i>Iohn

his goods any hurt by Witchcraft; did couenant with the said <i>Anne</i>,
that if she would hurt neither of them, she should yearely haue one

in the house of <i>Anthony Nutter</i> of Pendle aforesaid, and being then
in company with <i>Anne Nutter</i>, daughter of the said <i>Anthony</i>: the
said <i>Anne Whittle</i>, alias <i>Chattox</i>, came into the said <i>Anthony

laughing, and saying, that they laughed at her the said <i>Chattox</i>:
well said then (sayes <i>Anne Chattox</i>) I will be meet with the one of

sicke, and within three weekes after died. And further, this Examinate
saith, That about two yeares agoe, she, this Examinate, hath heard,
That the said <i>Anne Whittle</i>, alias <i>Chattox</i>, was suspected for
bewitching the drinke of <i>Iohn Moore</i> of Higham Gentleman:<a href="#E4b2">[E4<i>b</i>2]</a> and

this Examinate espying, the said <i>Anne Chattox</i> would haue hidde with

said <i>Moore</i> did charge the said <i>Chattox</i> to haue bewitched: for
which the said <i>Chattox</i> did curse and worry the said <i>Moore</i>, and
said she would be Reuenged of the said <i>Moore</i>: whereupon the said

<p>Barbarous and inhumane Monster, beyond example; so farre from
sensible vnderstanding of thy owne miserie, as to bring thy owne
naturall children into mischiefe and bondage; and thy selfe to be a
witnesse vpon the Gallowes, to see thy owne children, by thy deuillish
instructions hatcht vp in Villanie and Witchcraft, to suffer with
thee, euen in the beginning of their time, a shamefull and vntimely
Death. Too much (so it be true) cannot be said or written of her. Such
was her life and condition: that euen at the Barre, when shee came to
receiue her Triall (where the least sparke of Grace or modestie would
haue procured fauour, or moued pitie) she was not able to containe her
selfe within the limits of any order or gouernment: but exclaiming, in
very outragious manner crying out against her owne children, and such
as came to prosecute Indictments &amp; Euidence for the Kings Maiestie
against her, for the death of their Children, Friends, and Kinsfolkes,
whome cruelly and bloudily, by her Enchauntments, Charmes, and
Sorceries she had murthered and cut off; sparing no man with fearefull
execrable curses and banning:<a href="#F2b">[F2<i>b</i>]</a> Such in generall was the common
opinion of the Countrey where she dwelt, in the Forrest of Pendle (a
place fit for people of such condition) that no man neere her, neither
his wife, children, goods, or cattell should be secure or free from
danger.</p>

<p>This <i>Elizabeth Deuice</i> was the daughter of <i>Elizabeth Sothernes</i>, old
<i>Dembdike</i>, a malicious, wicked, and dangerous Witch for fiftie
yeares, as appeareth by Record: and how much longer, the Deuill and
shee knew best with whome shee made her couenant.</p>

<p>It is very certaine, that amongst all these Witches there was not a
more dangerous and deuillish Witch to execute mischiefe, hauing old
<i>Dembdike</i>, her mother, to assist her; <i>Iames Deuice</i> and <i>Alizon
Deuice</i>, her owne naturall children, all prouided with Spirits, vpon
any occasion of offence readie to assist her.</p>

<p>Vpon her Examination, although Master <i>Nowel</i> was very circumspect,
and exceeding carefull in dealing with her, yet she would confesse
nothing, vntill it pleased God to raise vp a yong maid, <i>Iennet
Deuice</i>, her owne daughter, about the age of nine yeares (a witnesse
vnexpected) to discouer all their Practises, Meetings, Consultations,
Murthers, Charmes, and Villanies: such, and in such sort, as I may
iustly say of them, as a reuerend and learned Iudge of this Kingdome
speaketh of the greatest Treason that euer was in this Kingdome, <i>Quis
h&#230;c posteris sic narrare poterit, vt facta non ficta esse videantur?</i>
That when these things shall be related to Posteritie, they will be
reputed matters fained, not done.</p>

<p>And then knowing, that both <i>Iennet Deuice</i>, her daughter, <i>Iames
Deuice</i>, her sonne, and <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, with others, had accused her
and layed open all things, in their Examinations taken before Master
<i>Nowel</i>, and although she were their owne naturall mother, yet they
did not spare to accuse her of euery particular fact, which in her
time she had committed, to their knowledge; she made a very liberall
and voluntarie Confession, as hereafter shall be giuen in euidence
against her, vpon her Arraignment and Triall.</p>

<p>This <i>Elizabeth Deuice</i> being at libertie, after Old <i>Dembdike</i> her
mother, <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, her daughter, and old <i>Chattocks</i> were
committed to the Castle of Lancaster for Witchcraft; laboured not a
little to procure a solemne meeting at Malkyn-Tower of the Graund
Witches of the Counties of Lancaster and Yorke, being yet vnsuspected
and vntaken, to consult of some speedie course for the deliuerance of
their friends, the Witches at Lancaster, and for the putting in
execution of some other deuillish practises of Murther and Mischiefe:
as vpon the Arraignement and Triall of <i>Iames Deuice</i>, her sonne,
shall hereafter in euery particular point appeare at large against
her.</p>

wicked and deuillish Arts, called <i>Witch-crafts</i>, <i>Inchantments</i>,

<h3>2. Indictment.</h3>

<p>The said <i>Elizabeth Deuice</i> was the second time indicted in the same
manner and forme, for the death of <i>Iames Robinson</i>, by Witch-craft.
<i>Contra pacem, &amp;c.</i></p>


<h3>3. Indictment.</h3>

<p>The said <i>Elizabeth Deuice</i>, was the third time with others, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Alice Nutter</i>, and <i>Elizabeth Sothernes</i>, alias <i>Old-Dembdike</i>, her
Grand-mother, Indicted in the same manner and forme, for the death of
<i>Henrie Mytton</i>. <i>Contra pacem, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>To these three seuerall Indictments vpon her Arraignement, shee
pleaded not guiltie; and for the tryall of her life, put her selfe
vpon God and her Countrie.</p>

<p>So as now the Gentlemen of the Iurie of life and death, stand charged
to finde, whether shee bee guiltie of them, or any of them.</p>

<p>Whereupon there was openly read, and giuen in euidence against her,
for the Kings Majestie, her owne voluntarie Confession and
Examination, when shee was apprehended, taken, and committed to the
Castle of Lancaster by M. <i>Nowel</i>, and M. <i>Bannester</i>, two of his

so amazed the child, as with weeping teares shee cryed out vnto my

<p>No intreatie, promise of fauour, or other respect, could put her to

child, to inforce her to denie that which she had formerly confessed

so all be wasted, and mulled away; so then the said <i>Iohn Robinson</i>

he could neither speake, heare, or stand, but was holden vp<a href="#H2a1">[H2<i>a</i>1]</a>
when hee was brought to the place of his Arraignement, to receiue his
triall.</p>

<p>This <i>Iames Deuice</i> of the Forrest of Pendle, being brought to the

and Arraigned; for that hee Felloniously had practised, vsed, and

<p>To these two seuerall Indictments vpon his Arraignment, he pleaded not

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>E saith, that vpon Sheare Thursday<a href="#H3a">[H3<i>a</i>]</a> was two yeares, his
Grand-Mother <i>Elizabeth Sothernes</i>, alias <i>Dembdike</i>, did bid him this
Examinate goe to the Church to receiue the Communion (the next day
after being Good Friday) and then not to eate the Bread the Minister
gaue him, but to bring it and deliuer it to such a thing as should
meet him in his way homewards: Notwithstanding her perswasions, this
Examinate did eate the Bread: and so in his comming homeward some
fortie roodes off the said Church, there met him a thing in the shape
of a Hare, who spoke vnto this Examinate, and asked him whether hee
had brought the Bread that his Grand-mother had bidden him, or no?
whereupon this Examinate answered, hee had not: and thereupon the said
thing threatned to pull this Examinate in peeces, and so this
Examinate thereupon marked himselfe to God, and so the said thing
vanished out of this Examinates sight. And within some foure daies
after that, there appeared in this Examinates sight, hard by the new
Church in Pendle, a thing like vnto a browne <i>Dogge</i>, who asked this
Examinate to giue him his Soule, and he should be reuenged of any whom
hee would: whereunto this Examinate answered, that his Soule was not
his to giue, but was his <i>Sauiour Iesus Christs</i>, but as much as was
in him this Examinate to giue, he was contented he should haue it.</p>

<p>And within two or three daies after, this Examinate went to the
Carre-Hall, and vpon some speeches betwixt Mistris <i>Towneley</i> and this
Examinate; Shee charging this Examinate and his said mother, to haue
stolne some Turues of hers, badde him packe the doores: and withall as
he went forth of the doore, the said Mistris <i>Towneley</i> gaue him a
knock betweene the shoulders: and about a day or two after that, there
appeared vnto this Examinate in his way, a thing like vnto a black
dog, who put this Examinate in minde of the said Mistris <i>Towneleyes</i>
falling out with him this Examinate; who bad this Examinate make a
Picture of Clay, like vnto the said Mistris <i>Towneley</i>: and that this
Examinate with the helpe of his Spirit (who then euer after bidde this
Examinate to call it <i>Dandy</i>) would kill or destroy the said Mistris
<i>Towneley</i>: and so the said dogge vanished out of this Examinates
sight. And the next morning after, this Examinate tooke Clay, and made
a Picture of the said Mistris <i>Towneley</i>, and dried it the same night
by the fire: and within a day after, hee, this Examinate began to
crumble the said Picture, euery day some, for the space of a weeke:
and within two daies after all was crumbled away; the said Mistris
<i>Towneley</i> died.</p>

<p>And hee further saith, That in Lent last one <i>Iohn Duckworth</i> of the
Lawnde, promised this Examinate an old shirt: and within a fortnight
after, this Examinate went to the said <i>Duckworthes</i> house, and
demanded the said old shirt: but the said <i>Duckworth</i> denied him
thereof. And going out of the said house, the said Spirit <i>Dandy</i>
appeared vnto this Examinate, and said, Thou didst touch the said
<i>Duckworth</i>; whereunto this Examinate answered, he did not touch him:
yes (said the Spirit againe) thou didst touch him, and therfore I haue
power of him: whereupon this Examinate ioyned with the said Spirit,
and then wished the said Spirit to kill the said <i>Duckworth</i>: and
within one weeke, then next after, <i>Duckworth</i> died.</p>

<p>This voluntary Confession and Examination of his owne, containing in
it selfe matter sufficient in Law to charge him, and to proue his
offences, contained in the two seuerall Indictments, was sufficient to
satisfie the Gentlemen of the Iurie of Life and Death, that he is
guiltie of them, and either of them: yet my Lord <i>Bromley</i> commanded,
for their better satisfaction, that the Witnesses present in Court
against any of the Prisoners, should be examined openly, <i>viua voce</i>,
that the Prisoner might both heare and answere to euery particular
point of their Euidence; notwithstanding any of their Examinations
taken before any of his Maiesties Iustices of Peace within the said
Countie.</p>

<p>Herein do but obserue the wonderfull work of God; to raise vp a young

<span class="sidenote"><i>Dandy.</i></span>her said brother called <i>Dandy</i>. And further,
this Examinate confesseth, &amp; saith: That her said brother about a
twelue month since, in the presence of this Examinate, and in the
house aforesaid, called for the said <i>Dandy</i>, who thereupon appeared:
asking this Examinates brother what he would haue him to doe. This
Examinates brother then said, he would haue him to helpe him to kill

for the doing of the same; and that her said brother, and the said
<i>Dandy</i>, did both in this Examinates hearing, say, they would make
away the said Mistris <i>Towneley</i>. And about a weeke after, this
Examinate comming to the Carre-Hall, saw the said Mistris <i>Towneley</i>
in the Kitchin there, nothing well: whereupon it came into this
Examinates minde, that her said brother, by the help of <i>Dandy</i>, had
brought the said Mistris <i>Towneley</i> into the state she then was in.</p>

<p>Which Examinat, although she were but very yong, yet it was wonderfull

himselfe could not deny, but there acknowledged in euery particular to

his hands: for besides his wicked and diuellish Spels, practises,
meetings to consult of murder and mischiefe, which (by Gods grace)
hereafter shall follow in order against him; there is yet more bloud
to be laid vnto his charge. For although he were but yong, and in the

from <i>Old Demdike</i> his Grand-mother, and <i>Elizabeth Deuice</i> his
mother, in so much that no time should passe since his first entrance
into that damnable Arte and exercise of Witchcrafts, Inchantments,
Charmes and Sorceries, without mischiefe or murder. Neither should any
man vpon the least occasion of offence giuen vnto him, escape his
hands, without some danger. For these particulars were no sooner giuen
in Euidence against him, when he was againe Indicted and Arraigned for
the murder of these two. <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><i>Iames Deuice</i> of the Forrest of Pendle aforesaid, in the Countie of

<p>To this Inditement vpon his Arraignement he pleaded thereunto not

persons might by that meanes make an escape &amp; get away; all which this
Examinate then heard them conferre of.</p>

<p>3 And the third Cause was, for that there was a woman dwelling in
Gisborne Parish, who came into this Examinates said Grandmothers
house, who there came and craued assistance of the rest of them that
were then there, for the killing of Master <i>Lister</i> of Westby, because
(as shee then said) he had borne malice vnto her, and had thought to
haue put her away at the last Assises at Yorke, but could not: and
this Examinate heard the said woman say, That her power was not strong
ynough to doe it her selfe, being now lesse then before time it had
beene.</p>

<p>And also, that the said <i>Iennet Preston</i> had a Spirit with her like
vnto a white Foale, with a blacke spot in the forhead.</p>

<p>And he also saith, That the names of the said Witches as were on
Good-Friday at this Examinates said Grand-mothers house, &amp; now this
Examinates owne mothers, for so many of them as he did know, were
these, <i>viz.</i> the wife of <i>Hugh Hargreiues</i> of Barley; the wife of
<i>Christopher Bulcock</i> of the Mosse end, and <i>Iohn</i> her sonne; the
mother of <i>Myles Nutter</i>; <i>Elizabeth</i>, the wife of <i>Christopher
Hargreiues</i>, of Thurniholme; <i>Christopher Howgate</i>, and <i>Elizabeth</i>,
his wife; <i>Alice Graye</i> of Coulne, and one <i>Mould-heeles</i> wife, of the
same: and this Examinate, and his Mother. And this Examinate further
saith, That all the said Witches went out of the said House in their
owne shapes and likenesses. And they all, by that they were forth of
the dores, were gotten on Horsebacke, like vnto Foales, some of one
colour, some of another; and <i>Prestons</i> wife was the last: and when
shee got on Horsebacke, they all presently vanished out of this
Examinates sight. And before their said parting away, they all
appointed to meete at the said <i>Prestons</i> wiues house that day
twelue-moneths; at which time the said <i>Prestons</i> wife promised to
make them a great Feast. And if they had occasion to meete in the
meane time, then should warning be giuen, that they all should meete
vpon <i>Romleyes</i> Moore.</p>

<p>What can be said more of this painfull Steward, that was so carefull
to prouide Mutton against this Feast and solemne meeting at
<i>Malking-Tower</i>, of this hellish and diuellish band of Witches, (the
like whereof hath not been heard of) then hath beene openly published
and declared against him at the Barre, vpon his Arraignement and
Triall: wherein it pleased God to raise vp Witnesses beyond
expectation to conuince him; besides his owne particular Examinations,
which being shewed and read vnto him; he acknowledged to be iust and
true. And what I promised to set forth against him, in the beginning
of his Arraignment and Triall, I doubt not but therein I haue
satisfied your expectation at large, wherein I haue beene very sparing
to charge him with any thing, but with sufficient matter of Record and
Euidence, able to satisfie the consciences of the Gentlemen of the
Iury of Life and Death; to whose good consideration I leaue him, with
the perpetuall Badge and Brand of as dangerous and malicious a Witch,
as euer liued in these parts of Lancashire, of his time: and spotted
with as much Innocent bloud, as euer any Witch of his yeares.</p>

<p>After all these proceedings, by direction of his Lordship, were their
seuerall Examinations, subscribed by euery one of them in particular,
shewed vnto them at the time of their Triall, &amp; acknowledged by th&#275;
to be true, deliuered to the gentlemen of the Iury of Life &amp; Death,
for the better satisfaction of their consciences: after due
consideration of which said seuerall examinations, confessions, and
voluntary declarations, as well of themselues as of their children,
friends and confederates, The Gentlemen deliuered vp their Verdict
against the Prisoners, as followeth. <i>viz.</i></p>

wife to <i>Henry Bierley</i>; <i>Iane Southworth</i>, late the wife of <i>Iohn
Southworth</i>, and one <i>Old Doewife</i>, all of Salmesburie aforesaid. And
shee saith, That now lately those foure women did violently draw her
by the haire of the head, and layd her on the toppe of a Hay-mowe, in
the said <i>Henry Bierleyes</i> Barne. And shee saith further, That not
long after the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i> did meete this Examinate neere
vnto the place where shee dwellleth, and first appeared in her owne
likenesse, and after that in the likenesse of a blacke Dogge, and as
this Examinate did goe ouer a Style, shee picked her off:<a href="#K4b">[K4<i>b</i>]</a>
howbeit shee saith shee had no hurt then, but rose againe, and went to
her Aunts in Osbaldeston, and returned backe againe to her Fathers
house the same night, being fetched home by her father. And she saith,
That in her way home-wards shee did then tell her Father, how shee
had beene dealt withall both then and at sundry times before that; and
before that time she neuer told any bodie thereof: and being examined
why she did not, she sayth, she could not speake thereof, though she
desired so to doe. And she further sayth, That vpon Saterday, being
the fourth of this instant Aprill, shee this Examinate going towards
Salmesbury bote, to meete her mother, comming from Preston, shee saw
the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i>, who met this Examinate at a place called
the Two Brigges, first in her owne shape, and afterwardes in the
likenesse of a blacke Dogge, with two legges, which Dogge went close
by the left side of this Examinate, till they came to a Pitte of
Water, and then the said Dogge spake, and persuaded this Examinate to
drowne her selfe there, saying, it was a faire and an easie death:
Whereupon this Examinate thought there came one to her in a white
sheete, and carried her away from the said Pitte, vpon the comming
whereof the said blacke Dogge departed away; and shortly after the
said white thing departed also: And after this Examinate had gone
further on her way, about the length of two or three Fields, the said
blacke Dogge did meete her againe, and going on her left side, as
aforesaid, did carrie her into a Barne of one <i>Hugh Walshmans</i>,<a href="#La">[L<i>a</i>]</a>
neere there by, and layed her vpon the Barne-floore, and couered this
Examinate with Straw on her bodie, and Haye on her head, and the Dogge
it selfe lay on the toppe of the said Straw, but how long the said
Dogge lay there, this Examinate cannot tell, nor how long her selfe
lay there: for shee sayth, That vpon her lying downe there, as
aforesaid, her Speech and Senses were taken from her: and the first
time shee knew where shee was, shee was layed vpon a bedde in the said
<i>Walshmans</i> house, which (as shee hath since beene told) was vpon the
Monday at night following: and shee was also told, That shee was found
and taken from the place where shee first lay, by some of her friends,
and carried into the said <i>Walshmans</i> house, within a few houres after
shee was layed in the Barne, as aforesaid. And shee further sayth,
That vpon the day following, being Tuesday, neere night of the same
day, shee this Examinate was fetched by her Father and Mother from the
said <i>Walshmans</i> house to her Fathers house. And shee saith, That at
the place before specified, called the Two Brigges, the said <i>Iennet
Bierley</i> and <i>Ellen Bierley</i> did appeare vnto her in their owne
shapes: whereupon this Examinate fell downe, and after that was not
able to speake, or goe, till the Friday following: during which time,
as she lay in her Fathers house, the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i> and <i>Ellen
Bierley</i> did once appeare vnto her in their owne shapes, but they did
nothing vnto her then, neither did shee euer see them since. And shee
further sayth, That a good while before all this, this Examinate did
goe with the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i>, her Grand-mother, and the said
<i>Ellen Bierley</i> her Aunt, at the bidding of her said Grand-mother, to
the house of one <i>Thomas Walshman</i>, in Salmesbury aforesaid. And
comming thither in the night, when all the house-hold was a-bed, the
doores being shut, the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i> did open them, but this
Examinate knoweth not how: and beeing come into the said house, this
Examinate and the said <i>Ellen Bierley</i> stayed there, and the said
<i>Iennet Bierley</i> went into the Chamber where the said <i>Walshman</i> and
his wife lay, &amp; from thence brought a little child,<a href="#L2a1">[L2<i>a</i>1]</a> which this
Examinate thinketh was in bed with it Father and Mother: and after the
said <i>Iennet Bierley</i> had set her downe by the fire, with the said
child, shee did thrust a naile into the nauell of the said child: and
afterwards did take a pen and put it in at the said place, and did
suck there a good space, and afterwards laid the child in bed againe:
and then the said <i>Iennet</i> and the said <i>Ellen</i> returned to their owne
houses, and this Examinate with them. And shee thinketh that neither
the said <i>Thomas Walshman</i>, nor his wife knew that the said child was
taken out of the bed from them. And shee saith also, that the said
child did not crie when it was hurt, as aforesaid: But shee saith,
that shee thinketh that the said child did thenceforth languish, and
not long after dyed. And after the death of the said child; the next
night after the buriall thereof, the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i> &amp; <i>Ellen
Bierley</i>, taking this Examinate with them, went to Salmesburie Church,
and there did take vp the said child, and the said <i>Iennet</i> did carrie
it out of the Church-yard in her armes, and then did put it in her lap
and carryed it home to her owne house, and hauing it there did boile
some therof in a Pot, and some did broile on the coales, of both which
the said <i>Iennet</i> &amp; <i>Ellen</i> did eate, and would haue had this
Examinate and one <i>Grace Bierley</i>, Daughter of the said <i>Ellen</i>, to
haue eaten with them, but they refused so to doe: And afterwards the
said <i>Iennet</i> &amp; <i>Ellen</i> did seethe the bones of the said child in a
pot, &amp; with the Fat that came out of the said bones, they said they
would annoint themselues,<a href="#L2a2">[L2<i>a</i>2]</a> that thereby they might sometimes
change themselues into other shapes. And after all this being done,
they said they would lay the bones againe in the graue the next night
following, but whether they did so or not, this Examinate knoweth not:
Neither doth shee know how they got it out of the graue at the first
taking of it vp. And being further sworne and examined, she deposeth &amp;
saith, that about halfe a yeare agoe, the said <i>Iennet Bierley</i>,
<i>Ellen Bierley</i>, <i>Iane Southworth</i>, and this Examinate (who went by
the appointment of the said <i>Iennet</i> her Grand mother) did meete at a
place called Red banck, vpon the North side of the water of Ribble,
euery Thursday and Sonday at night by the space of a fortnight, and at
the water side there came vnto them, as they went thether, foure black
things, going vpright, and yet not like men in the face: which foure
did carrie the said three women and this Examinate ouer the Water, and
when they came to the said Red Banck they found some thing there which
they did eate. But this Examinate saith, shee neuer saw such meate;
and therefore shee durst not eate thereof, although her said Grand
mother did bidde her eate. And after they had eaten, the said three
Women and this Examinate danced, euery one of them with one of the
blacke things aforesaid, and after their dancing the said black things
did pull downe the said three Women, and did abuse their bodies, as
this Examinate thinketh, for shee saith, that the black thing that was
with her, did abuse her bodie.</p>

<p>The said Examinate further saith vpon her Oth, That about ten dayes
after her Examination taken at Blackborne, shee this Examinate being
then come to her Fathers house againe, after shee had beene certaine
dayes at her Vnckles house in Houghton: <i>Iane Southworth</i> widow, did
meet this Examinate at her Fathers house dore and did carrie her into
the loft,<a href="#L3a">[L3<i>a</i>]</a> and there did lay her vppon the floore, where shee
was shortly found by her Father and brought downe, and laid in a bed,
as afterwards shee was told: for shee saith, that from the first
meeting of the said <i>Iane Southworth</i>, shee this Examinate had her
speech and senses taken from her. But the next day shee saith, shee
came somewhat to her selfe, and then the said Widow <i>Southworth</i> came
againe to this Examinate to her bed-side, and tooke her out of bed,
and said to this Examinate, that shee did her no harme the other time,
in respect of that shee now would after doe to her, and thereupon put
her vpon a hey-stack, standing some three or foure yards high from the
earth, where shee was found after great search made, by a neighbours
Wife neare dwelling, and then laid in her bedde againe, where she
remained speechlesse and senselesse as before, by the space of two or
three daies: And being recouered, within a weeke after shee saith,
that the said <i>Iane Southworth</i> did come againe to this Examinate at
her fathers house and did take her away, and laid her in a ditch neare
to the house vpon her face, and left her there, where shee was found
shortly after, and laid vpon a bedde, but had not her senses againe of
a day &amp; a night, or thereabouts. And shee further saith, That vpon
Tuesday last before the taking of this her Examination, the said <i>Iane
Southworth</i> came to this Examinates Fathers house, and finding this
Examinate without the doore, tooke her and carried her into the Barne,
and thrust her head amongst a companie of boords that were there
standing, where shee was shortly after found and laid in a bedde, and
remained in her old fit till the Thursday at night following.</p>

<p>And being further examined touching her being at Red-bancke, shee
saith, That the three women, by her before named, were carried backe
againe ouer Ribble, by the same blacke things that carried them
thither; and saith that at their said meeting in the Red-bancke, there
did come also diuers other women, and did meete them there, some old,
some yong, which this Examinate thinketh did dwell vpon the North-side
of Ribble, because she saw them not come ouer the Water: but this
Examinate knew none of them, neither did she see them eat or dance, or
doe anything else that the rest did, sauing that they were there and
looked on.</p>

<p>These particular points of Euidence being thus vrged against the
Prisoners: the father of this <i>Grace Sowerbutts</i> prayed that <i>Thomas
Walshman</i>, whose childe they are charged to murther, might be examined
as a witnes vpon his oath, for the Kings Maiestie, against the
Prisoners at the Barre: who vpon this strange deuised accusation,
deliuered by this impudent wench, were in opinion of many of that
great Audience guilty of this bloudie murther, and more worthy to die
then any of these Witches.</p>

<b>
<span class="smcap">Grace Sowerbutts</span>, <i>viz.</i></b><a href="#M1b">[M1<i>b</i>]</a></p>

<h3>Euidence.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>Hat for the space of some yeares she hath been haunted
and vexed with some women, who haue vsed to come to her.</i></p></div>

<p>The Iesuite forgot to instruct his Scholler how long it is since she
was tormented: it seemes it is long since he read the old Badge of a
Lyer, <i>Oportet mendacem esse memorem</i>. He knowes not how long it is
since they came to church, after which time they began to practise
Witchcraft. It is a likely thing the Torment and Panges of Witchcraft
can be forgotten; and therefore no time can be set downe.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Shee saith that now lately these foure women did violently
draw her by the haire of the head, and lay her on the top of
a Hay-mow.</i></p></div>

<p>Heere they vse great violence to her, whome in another place they make
choise to be of their counsell, to go with them to the house of
<i>Walshman</i> to murther the childe. This courtesie deserues no discouery
of so foule a Fact.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Not long after, the said</i> Iennet Bierley <i>did meet this
Examinate neere vnto the place where she dwelled, and first
appeared in her owne likenesse, and after that in the
likenesse of a blacke Dogge.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Vno &amp; eodem tempore</i>, shee transformed her selfe into a Dogge. I
would know by what meanes any Priest can maintaine this point of
Euidence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>And as shee went ouer a Style, shee picked her ouer, but
had no hurt.</i></p></div>

<p>This is as likely to be true as the rest, to throw a child downe from
the toppe of a House, and neuer hurt her great toe.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She rose againe; had no hurt, went to her Aunt, and
returned backe againe to her Fathers house, being fetched
home.</i></p></div>

<p>I pray you obserue these contrarieties, in order as they are placed,
to accuse the Prisoners.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Saterday the fourth of this instant Aprill.</i></p></div>

<p>Which was about the very day the Witches of the Forrest of Pendle were
sent to Lancaster. Now was the time for the Seminarie to instruct,
accuse, and call into question these poore women: for the wrinkles of
an old wiues face is good euidence to the Iurie against a Witch.<a href="#M2a">[M2<i>a</i>]</a>
And how often will the common people say (<i>Her eyes are sunke in her
head</i>, <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>blesse vs from her.</i>) But old <i>Chattox</i> had
<i>Fancie</i>,<a href="#M2b">[M2<i>b</i>]</a> besides her withered face, to accuse her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>This Examinate did goe with the said</i> Iennet Bierley <i>her
Grand-mother, and</i> Ellen Bierley <i>her Aunt, to the house of</i>
Walshman, <i>in the night-time, to murther a Child in strange
manner.</i></p></div>

<p>This of all the rest is impossible, to make her of their counsell, to
doe murther, whome so cruelly and barbarously they pursue from day to
day, and torment her. The Witches of the Forrest of Pendle were neuer
so cruell nor barbarous.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>And shee also saith, the Child cried not when it was hurt.</i></p></div>

<p>All this time the Child was asleepe, or the Child was of an
extraordinarie patience, <i>&#244; inauditum facinus</i>!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>After they had eaten, the said three women and this
Examinate daunced euery one of them with one of the Blacke
things: and after, the Blacke things abused the said women.</i></p></div>

<p>Here is good Euidence to take away their liues. This is more proper
for the Legend of Lyes, then the Euidence of a witnesse vpon Oath,
before a reuerend and learned Iudge, able to conceiue this Villanie,
and finde out the practise. Here is the Religious act of a Priest, but
behold the euent of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She describes the foure Blacke things to goe vpright, but
not like Men in the face.</i></p></div>

<p>The Seminarie mistakes the face for the feete: For <i>Chattox</i> and all
her fellow Witches agree, the Deuill is clouen-footed: but <i>Fancie</i>
had a very good face, and was a very proper Man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>About tenne dayes after her Examination taken at
Black-borne, then she was tormented.</i></p></div>

<p>Still he pursues his Proiect: for hearing his Scholler had done well,
he laboured she might doe more in this nature. But notwithstanding,
many things are layd to be in the times when they were Papists: yet
the Priest neuer tooke paines to discouer them, nor instruct his
Scholler, vntill they came to Church. Then all this was the Act of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, to raise a child to open all things, and then to difcouer his
plotted Tragedie. Yet in this great discouerie, the Seminarie forgot
to deuise a Spirit for them.</p>

<p>And for <i>Thomas Walshman</i>, vpon his Oath he sayth, That his Childe had
beene sicke by the space of a fortnight, or three weekes, before it
died. And <i>Grace Sowerbutts</i> saith, they tooke it out of the bedde,
strucke a nayle into the Nauell, sucked bloud, layd it downe againe;
and after, tooke it out of the Graue, with all the rest, as you haue
heard. How these two agree, you may, vpon view of their Euidence, the
better conceiue, and be able to judge.</p>

<p>How well this proiect, to take away the liues of three innocent poore
creatures by practise and villanie; to induce a young Scholler to
commit periurie, to accuse her owne Grand-mother, Aunt, &amp;c. agrees
either with the Title of a Iesuite, or the dutie of a Religious
Priest, who should rather professe Sinceritie and Innocencie, then
practise Trecherie: But this was lawfull; for they are Heretikes
accursed, to leaue the companie of Priests; to frequent Churches,
heare the word of <span class="smcap">God</span> preached, and professe Religion sincerely.</p>

<p>But by the course of Times and Accidents, wise men obserue, that very
seldome hath any mischieuous attempt beene vnder-taken without the
direction or assistance of a Iesuit, or Seminarie Priest.</p>

<p>Who did not condemne these Women vpon this euidence, and hold them
guiltie of this so foule and horrible murder? But Almightie God, who
in his prouidence had prouided meanes for their deliuerance, although
the Priest by the help of the Deuill, had prouided false witnesses to
accuse them; yet <span class="smcap">God</span> had prepared and placed in the Seate of Iustice,
an vpright Iudge to sit in Iudgement vpon their liues, who after he
had heard all the euidence at large against the Prisoners for the
Kings Majestie, demanded of them what answere they could make. They
humbly vpon their knees with weeping teares, desired him for Gods
cause to examine <i>Grace Sowerbuts</i>, who set her on, or by whose meanes
this accusation came against them.</p>

<p>Immediately the countenance of this <i>Grace Sowerbuts</i> changed: The
witnesses being behinde, began to quarrell and accuse one an other. In
the end his Lordship examined the Girle, who could not for her life
make any direct answere, but strangely amazed, told him, shee was put
to a Master to learne, but he told her nothing of this.</p>

<p>But here as his Lordships care and paines was great to discouer the
practises of these odious Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, and other
places, now vpon their triall before him: So was he desirous to
discouer this damnable practise, to accuse these poore Women, and
bring their liues in danger, and thereby to deliuer the innocent.</p>

<p>And as he openly deliuered it vpon the Bench, in the hearing of this
great Audience: That if a Priest or Iesuit had a hand in one end of
it, there would appeare to bee knauerie, and practise in the other end
of it. And that it might the better appeare to the whole World,
examined <i>Thomas Sowerbuts</i>, what Master taught his daughter: in
generall termes, he denyed all.</p>

<p>The Wench had nothing to say, but her Master told her nothing of this.
In the end, some that were present told his Lordship the truth, and
the Prisoners informed him how shee went to learne with one <i>Thompson</i>
a Seminarie Priest, who had instructed and taught her this accusation
against them, because they were once obstinate Papists, and now came
to Church. Here is the discouerie of this Priest, and of his whole
practise. Still this fire encreased more and more, and one witnesse
accusing an other, all things were laid open at large.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
In the end his Lordship tooke away the Girle from
her Father, and<br />
committed her to M. <i>Leigh</i>, a very religious
Preacher,<a href="#M4a">[M4<i>a</i>]</a><br />
and M. <i>Chisnal</i>, two Iustices of the Peace,
to be carefully<br />
examined. Who tooke great paines to

deliuered this<br />

<p>These Examinations being taken, they were brought into the Court, and
there openly in the presence of this great Audience published, and
declared to the Iurie of Life and Death; and thereupon the Gentlemen
of their Iury required to consider of them. For although they stood
vpon their Triall, for matter of Fact of Witchcraft, Murther, and much
more of the like nature: yet in respect all their Accusations did
appeare to bee practise: they were now to consider of them, and to
acquit them. Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great
care and paines of this honorable Iudge, deliuered from the danger of
this conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open: of
whose fact I may lawfully say; <i>Etiam si ego tacuero clamabunt
lapides</i>.</p>

<p>These are but ordinary with Priests and Iesuites: no respect of Bloud,
kindred, or friendship, can moue them to forbeare their Conspiracies:
for when he had laboured treacherously to seduce and conuert them, and
yet could doe no good; then deuised he this meanes.</p>

<p><i>God of his great mercie deliuer vs all from them and their damnable
conspiracies: and when any of his Maiesties subiects, so free and
innocent as these, shall come in question, grant them as honorable a
Triall, as Reuerend and worthy a Iudge to sit in Iudgement vpon them;
and in the end as speedie a deliuerance. And for that which I haue
heard of them; seene with my eyes, and taken paines to Reade of them:
My humble prayer shall be to God Almightie.</i> Vt Conuertantur ne
pereant. Aut confundantur ne noceant.</p>

<p>Vch is the horror of Murther, and the crying sinne of Bloud, that
it will neuer bee satisfied but with Bloud. So fell it out with this
miserable creature, <i>Anne Redferne</i>, the daughter of <i>Anne Whittle</i>,
alias <i>Chattox</i>: who, as shee was her Mother, and brought her into the
World, so was she the meanes to bring her into this danger, and in the
end to her Execution, for much Bloud spilt, and many other mischiefes
done.</p>

<p>For vpon Tuesday night (although you heare little of her at the
Arraignement and Triall of old <i>Chattox</i>, her Mother) yet was shee
arraigned for the murther of <i>Robert Nutter</i>, and others: and by the
fauour and mercifull consideration of the Iurie, the Euidence being
not very pregnant against her, she was acquited, and found Not
guiltie.</p>

<p>Such was her condition and course of life, as had she liued, she would
haue beene very dangerous: for in making pictures of Clay, she was
more cunning then any: But the innocent bloud yet vnsatisfied, and
crying out vnto <span class="smcap">God</span> for satisfaction and reuenge; the crie of his
people (to deliuer them from the danger of such horrible and bloudie
executioners, and from her wicked and damnable practises) hath now
againe brought her to a second Triall, where you shall heare what wee
haue vpon Record against her.</p>

<p>This <i>Anne Redferne</i>, prisoner in the Castle at Lancaster, being
brought to the Barre, before the great Seat of Iustice, was there,
according to the former order and course, indicted and arraigned, for
that she felloniously had practised, exercised, and vsed her deuillish
and wicked Arts, called <i>Witchcrafts</i>, <i>Inchauntments</i>, <i>Charmes</i>, and
<i>Sorceries</i>, in and vpon one <i>Christopher Nutter</i>, and him the said
<i>Christopher Nutter</i>, by force of the same Witchcrafts, felloniously
did kill and murther, <i>Contra formam Statuti &amp;c. Et Contra Pacem &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Vpon her Arraignement to this Indictment, she pleaded <i>Not-Guiltie</i>;
and for the triall of her life put her selfe vpon <span class="smcap">God</span> and the

Examinate now remembreth it: and there, within three yards of the East

Redferne</i>, wife of the said <i>Thomas Redferne</i>, and daughter of the
said <i>Anne Whittle</i>, the one on the one side of a Ditch, and the other
on the other side, and two pictures of Clay or Marle lying by them,
and the third picture the said <i>Anne Whittle</i> was making. And the said
<i>Anne Redferne</i>, her said daughter, wrought her Clay or Marle to make
the third picture withall. And this Examinate passing by them, a
Spirit, called <i>Tibbe</i>, in the shape of a blacke Cat, appeared vnto
her this Examinate and said, Turne backe againe, and doe as they doe.
To whom this Examinate said, What are they doing? Whereunto the said
Spirit said, They are making three pictures: whereupon shee asked,
whose pictures they were? whereunto the said Spirit said, They are the
pictures of <i>Christopher Nutter</i>, <i>Robert Nutter</i>, and <i>Mary</i>, wife of
the said <i>Robert Nutter</i>. But this Examinate denying to goe backe to
helpe them to make the pictures aforesaid, the said Spirit seeming to
be angrie therefore, shot or pushed this Examinate into the Ditch; and
so shedde the milke which this Examinate had in a Kanne, or Kitt; and
so thereupon the Spirit at that time vanished out of this Examinates
sight. But presently after that, the said Spirit appeared vnto this
Examinate again in the shape of a Hare, and so went with her about a
quarter of a myle, but said nothing vnto her this Examinate, nor shee

said Brother then say vnto his said Father these words, or to this

will procure them to bee laid where they shall be glad to bite Lice in

them? What were the names of any of them? And how she knew them to be
such as she named?</p>

<p>In the end being examined by my Lord,<a href="#P2a1">[P2<i>a</i>1]</a> Whether she knew them
that were there by their faces, if she saw them? she told my Lord she
should: whereupon in the presence of this great Audience, in open
Court, she went and tooke <i>Alice Nutter</i>, this prisoner, by the hand,
and accused her to be one: and told her in what place shee sat at the
Feast at Malking-Tower, at the great assembly of the Witches, and who
sat next her: what conference they had, and all the rest of their
proceedings at large, without any manner of contrarietie.</p>

<p>Being demaunded further by his Lordship, Whether she knew <i>Iohan a
Style</i>?<a href="#P2a2">[P2<i>a</i>2]</a> she alledged, she knew no such wom&#257; to be there,
neither did she euer heare her name.</p>

<p>This could be no forged or false Accusation, but the very Act of <span class="smcap">God</span>
to discouer her.</p>

<p>Thus was no meanes left to doe her all indifferent fauour, but it was
vsed to saue her life; and to this shee could giue no answere.</p>

<p>But nothing would serue: for old <i>Dembdike</i>, old <i>Chattox</i>, and
others, had charged her with innocent bloud, which cries out for
Reuenge, and will be satisfied. And therefore Almightie <span class="smcap">God</span>, in his
Iustice, hath cut her off.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
And here I leaue her, vntill shee come to her Execution,
where<br />
you shall heare shee died very impenitent;
insomuch as<br />
her owne children were neuer able to
moue her to<br />

Witches? since all their Meetings, Conspiracies, Practises, and
Murthers, are the workes of Darkenesse: But to discouer this wicked
<i>Furie</i>, <span class="smcap">God</span> hath not only raised meanes beyond expectation, by the
voluntarie Confession and Accusation of all that are gone before, to
accuse this Witch (being Witches, and thereby witnesses of her doings)

to be one, and a Principall in that wicked assembly at Malking-Tower,
to deuise such a damnable course for the deliuerance of their friends
at Lancaster, as to kill the Gaoler, and blow vp the Castle, wherein
the Deuill did but labour to assemble them together, and so being
knowne to send them all one way: And herein I shall commend vnto your

that liued in the world, free from suspition of any such offences, as
are proued against them: And thereby the more dangerous, that in the

<p>F there were nothing to charge these Prisoners withall, whom now
you may behold vpon their Arraignement and Triall but their poasting
in haste to the great Assembly at Malking-Tower, there to aduise and

the Witches in the Castle at Lancaster: Ioyne with <i>Iennet Preston</i>
for the murder of Master <i>Lister</i>; and such like wicked &amp; diuellish
practises: It were sufficient to accuse them for Witches, &amp; to bring
their liues to a lawfull Triall. But amongst all the Witches in this
company, there is not a more fearefull and diuellish Act committed,
and voluntarily confessed by any of them, comparable to this, vnder
the degree of Murder: which impudently now (at the Barre hauing
formerly confessed;)<a href="#Q3a1">[Q3<i>a</i>1]</a> they forsweare, swearing they were neuer
at the great assembly at Malking Tower; although the very Witches that
were present in that action with them, iustifie, maintaine, and sweare
the same to be true against them: Crying out in very violent &amp;
outragious manner, euen to the gallowes,<a href="#Q3a2">[Q3<i>a</i>2]</a> where they died
impenitent for any thing we know, because they died silent in the
particulars. These of all others were the most desperate wretches
(void of all feare or grace) in all this Packe; Their offences not
much inferiour to Murther: for which you shall heare what matter of
Record wee haue against them; and whether they be worthie to continue,
we leaue it to the good consideration of the Iury.</p>

first was, for the naming of the Spirit which <i>Allison Deuice</i>, now

<p>Ehold, aboue all the rest, this lamentable spectacle of a poore
distressed Pedler, how miserably hee was tormented, and what
punishment hee endured for a small offence, by the wicked and damnable
practise of this odious Witch, first instructed therein by old
<i>Dembdike</i> her Grand-mother, of whose life and death with her good
conditions, I haue written at large before in the beginning of this
worke, out of her owne Examinations and other Records, now remayning
with the Clarke of the Crowne at Lancaster: And by her Mother brought
vp in this detestable course of life; wherein I pray you obserue but
the manner and course of it in order, euen to the last period at her
Execution, for this horrible fact, able to terrifie and astonish any
man liuing.</p>

<p>This <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, Prisoner in the Castle of Lancaster, being
brought to the Barre before the great Seat of Iustice, was there
according to the former order and course indicted and arraigned, for
that shee felloniously had practised, exercised, and vsed her
Deuillish and wicked Arts, called <i>Witch-crafts</i>, <i>Inchantments</i>,
<i>Charmes</i>, and <i>Sorceries</i>, in, and vpon one <i>Iohn Law</i>, a
Petti-chapman, and him had lamed; so that his bodie wasted and
consumed, &amp;c. <i>Contra formam Statuti, &amp;c. Et contra pacem dicti Domini
Regis, Coronam &amp; Dignitatem, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Vpon the Arraignement, The poore Pedler, by name <i>Iohn Law</i>, being in
the Castle about the Moot-hall, attending to be called, not well able
to goe or stand, being led thether by his poore sonne <i>Abraham Law</i>:
My Lord <i>Gerrard</i><a href="#R3a">[R3<i>a</i>]</a> moued the Court to call the poore Pedler, who
was there readie, and had attended all the Assizes, to giue euidence
for the Kings Majestie against the said <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, Prisoner at
the Barre, euen now vpon her Triall. The Prisoner being at the Barre,
&amp; now beholding the Pedler, deformed by her Witch-craft, and
transformed beyond the course of Nature, appeared to giue euidence
against her; hauing not yet pleaded to her Indictment, saw it was in
vaine to denie it, or stand vpon her justification: Shee humbly vpon
her knees at the Barre with weeping teares, prayed the Court to heare
her.</p>

<p>Whereupon my Lord <i>Bromley</i> commanded shee should bee brought out from
the Prisoners neare vnto the Court, and there on her knees, shee
humbly asked forgiuenesse for her offence: And being required to make
an open declaration or confession of her offence: Shee confessed as
followeth. <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>He saith, That about two yeares agone, her Grand-mother, called
<i>Elizabeth Sothernes</i>, alias <i>Dembdike</i>, did (sundry times in going or
walking together, as they went begging) perswade and aduise this
Examinate to let a Diuell or a Familiar appeare to her, and that shee,
this Examinate would let him suck at some part of her; and she might
haue and doe what shee would. And so not long after these perswasions,
this Examinate being walking towards the Rough-Lee, in a Close of one
<i>Iohn Robinsons</i>, there appeared vnto her a thing like vnto a Blacke
Dogge: speaking vnto her, this Examinate, and desiring her to giue him
her Soule, and he would giue her power to doe any thing shee would:
whereupon this Examinate being therewithall inticed, and setting her
downe; the said Blacke-Dogge did with his mouth (as this Examinate
then thought) sucke at her breast, a little below her Paps, which
place did remain blew halfe a yeare next after: which said
Blacke-Dogge did not appeare to this Examinate, vntill the eighteenth
day of March last: at which time this Examinate met with a Pedler on
the high-way, called Colne-field, neere vnto Colne: and this Examinate
demanded of the said Pedler to buy some pinnes of him; but the said
Pedler sturdily answered this Examinate that he would not loose his
Packe; and so this Examinate parting with him: presently there
appeared to this Examinate the Blacke-Dogge, which appeared vnto her
as before: which Black Dogge spake vnto this Examinate in English,
saying; What wouldst thou haue me to do vnto yonder man? to whom this
Examinate said, What canst thou do at him? and the Dogge answered
againe, I can lame him: whereupon this Examinat answered, and said to
the said Black Dogge, Lame him: and before the Pedler was gone fortie
Roddes further, he fell downe Lame: and this Examinate then went after
the said Pedler; and in a house about the distance aforesaid, he was
lying Lame: and so this Examinate went begging in Trawden Forrest that
day, and came home at night: and about fiue daies next after, the said
Black-Dogge did appeare to this Examinate, as she was going a begging,
in a Cloase neere the New-Church in Pendle, and spake againe to her,
saying; Stay and speake with me; but this Examinate would not:
Sithence which time this Examinat neuer saw him.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y Lord <i>Bromley</i>, and all the whole Court not a little wondering,
as they had good cause, at this liberall and voluntarie confession of
the Witch; which is not ordinary with people of their condition and

commanded him vpon his oath to declare the manner how, and in what
sort he was handled; how he came to be lame, and so to be deformed;

past, hee being a Pedler, went with his Packe of wares at his backe
thorow Colne-field: where vnluckily he met with <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, now
Prisoner at the Barre, who was very earnest with him for pinnes, but
he would giue her none: whereupon she seemed to be very angry; and
when hee was past her, hee fell downe lame in great extremitie; and
afterwards by meanes got into an Ale-house in Colne, neere vnto the
place where hee was first bewitched: and as hee lay there in great
paine, not able to stirre either hand or foote; he saw a great
Black-Dogge stand by him, with very fearefull firie eyes, great teeth,
and a terrible countenance, looking him in the face; whereat he was
very sore afraid: and immediately after came in the said <i>Alizon

<p>After which time hee was tormented both day and night with the said
<i>Alizon Deuice</i>; and so continued lame, not able to trauell or take

said to her, <i>This thou knowest to be too true</i>: and thereupon she
humblie acknowledged the same, and cried out to God to forgiue her;
and vpon her knees with weeping teares, humbly prayed him to forgiue

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>Eing sworne and examined, saith, That vpon Saturday last saue one,
being the one and twentieth day of this instant March, he, this
Examinate was sent for, by a letter that came from his father, that he
should come to his father, <i>Iohn Law</i>, who then lay in Colne
speechlesse, and had the left-side lamed all saue his eye: and when
this Examinate came to his father, his said father had something
recouered his speech, and did complaine that hee was pricked with
Kniues, Elsons and Sickles,<a href="#Sa">[S<i>a</i>]</a> and that the same hurt was done vnto
him at Colne-field, presently after that <i>Alizon Deuice</i> had offered
to buy some pinnes of him, and she had no money to pay for them
withall; but as this Examinates father told this Examinate, he gaue
her some pinnes. And this Examinate further saith, That he heard his
said father say, that the hurt he had in his lamenesse was done vnto
him by the said <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, by Witchcraft. And this Examinate
further saith, that hee heard his said Father further say, that the
said <i>Alizon Deuice</i> did lie vpon him and trouble him. And this
Examinate seeing his said Father so tormented with the said <i>Alizon</i>
and with one other olde woman, whome this Examinates Father did not
know as it seemed: This Examinate made search after the said <i>Alizon</i>,
and hauing found her, brought her to his said Father yesterday being
the nine and twenteth of this instant March: whose said Father in the
hearing of this Examinate and diuers others did charge the said
<i>Alizon</i> to haue bewitched him, which the said <i>Alizon</i>
confessing<a href="#Sb">[S<i>b</i>]</a> did aske this Examinates said Father forgiuenesse
vpon her knees for the same; whereupon this Examinates Father
accordingly did forgiue her. Which Examination in open Court vpon his
oath hee iustified to be true.</p>

<p>Whereupon it was there affirmed to the Court that this <i>Iohn Law</i> the
Pedler, before his vnfortunate meeting with this Witch, was a verie
able sufficient stout man of Bodie, and a goodly man of Stature. But
by this Deuillish art of <i>Witch-craft</i> his head is drawne awrie, his
Eyes and face deformed, His speech not well to bee vnderstood; his
Thighes and Legges starcke lame: his Armes lame especially the left
side, his handes lame and turned out of their course, his Bodie able
to indure no trauell: and thus remaineth at this present time.</p>

<p>The Prisoner being examined by the Court whether shee could helpe the
poore Pedler to his former strength and health, she answered she could
not, and so did many of the rest of the Witches: But shee, with
others, affirmed, That if old <i>Dembdike</i> had liued, shee could and
would haue helped him out of that great miserie, which so long he hath
endured for so small an offence, as you haue heard.</p>

<p>These things being thus openly published against her, and she knowing
her selfe to be guiltie of euery particular, humbly acknowledged the
Indictment against her to be true, and that she was guiltie of the
offence therein contained, and that she had iustly deserued death for
that and many other such like: whereupon she was carried away, vntill
she should come to the Barre to receiue her judgement of death.</p>

<p>Oh, who was present at this lamentable spectacle, that was not moued
with pitie to behold it!</p>

<p>Hereupon my Lord <i>Gerard</i>, Sir <i>Richard Houghton</i>, and others, who
much pitied the poore Pedler, At the entreatie of my Lord <i>Bromley</i>
the Iudge, promised some present course should be taken for his
reliefe and maintenance; being now discharged and sent away.</p>

<p>But here I may not let her passe; for that I find some thing more vpon
Record to charge her withall: for although she were but a young Witch,
of a yeares standing, and thereunto induced by <i>Dembdike</i> her
Grand-mother, as you haue formerly heard, yet she was spotted with
innocent bloud among the rest: for in one part of the Examination of

<p>Hus farre haue I proceeded in hope your patience will endure the
end of this discourse, which craues time, and were better not begunne
at all, then not perfected.</p>

<p>This <i>Margaret Pearson</i> was the wife of <i>Edward Pearson</i> of Paddiham,
in the Countie of Lancaster; little inferiour in her wicked and
malicious course of life to any that hath gone before her: A very
dangerous Witch of long continuance, generally suspected and feared in
all parts of the Countrie, and of all good people neare her, and not
without great cause: For whosoeuer gaue her any iust occasion of
offence, shee tormented with great miserie, or cut off their
children, goods, or friends.</p>

<p>This wicked and vngodly Witch reuenged her furie vpon goods, so that
euery one neare her sustained great losse. I place her in the end of
these notorious Witches, by reason her iudgement is of an other
Nature, according to her offence; yet had not the fauour and mercie of
the Iurie beene more than her desert, you had found her next to old
<i>Dembdike</i>; for this is the third time shee is come to receiue her
Triall; one time for murder by Witch-craft; an other time for
bewitching a Neighbour; now for goods.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How long shee hath been a Witch, the Deuill and shee knows
best.</p></div>

<p>The Accusations, Depositions, and particular Examinations vpon Record
against her are infinite, and were able to fill a large Volume; But
since shee is now only to receiue her Triall for this last offence. I
shall proceede against her in order, and set forth what matter we haue
vpon Record, to charge her withall.</p>

<p>This <i>Margaret Pearson</i>, Prisoner in the Castle at Lancaster: Being
brought to the Barre before the great Seat of Iustice; was there
according to the course and order of the Law Indicted and Arraigned,
for that shee had practised, exercised, and vsed her diuellish and
wicked Arts, called <i>Witchcrafts</i>, <i>Inchantments</i>, <i>Charmes</i> and
<i>Sorceries</i>, and one Mare of the goods and Chattels of one <i>Dodgeson</i>
of Padiham, in the Countie of Lancaster, wickedly, maliciously, and
voluntarily did kill. <i>Contra formam Statuti, &amp;c. Et Contra pacem
dicti Domini Regis. &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Vpon her Arraignement to this Indictment, shee pleaded not guiltie;
And for the triall of her offence put her selfe vpon God and her
Countrie.</p>

<p>So as now the Gentlemen of the Iurie of her offence and death, stand

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>He said Examinate vpon his Oath saith, That before his Marriage
hee heard say that the said <i>Isabel Robey</i> was not pleased that hee
should marrie his now wife: whereupon this Examinate called the said
<i>Isabel</i> Witch, and said that hee did not care for her. Then within
two dayes next after this Examinate was sore pained in his bones: And
this Examinate hauing occasion to meete Master <i>Iohn Hawarden</i> at
Peaseley Crosse, wished one <i>Thomas Lyon</i> to goe thither with him,
which they both did so; but as they came home-wards, they both were in
euill case. But within a short time after, this Examinate and the said
<i>Thomas Lyon</i> were both very well amended.</p>

<p>And this Examinate further saith, that about foure yeares last past,
his now wife was angrie with the said <i>Isabel</i>, shee then being in his
house, and his said Wife thereupon went out of the house, and
presently after that the said <i>Isabel</i> went likewise out of the house
not well pleased, as this Examinate then did thinke, and presently
after vpon the same day, this Examinate with his said wife working in
the Hay, a paine and a starknesse fell into the necke of this Examinat
which grieued him very sore; wherup&#333; this Examinat sent to one
<i>Iames</i> a Glouer, which then dwelt in Windle, and desired him to pray
for him, and within foure or fiue dayes next after this Examinate did
mend very well. Neuerthelesse this Examinate during the same time was
very sore pained, and so thirstie withall, and hot within his body,
that hee would haue giuen any thing hee had, to haue slaked his
thirst, hauing drinke enough in the house, and yet could not drinke
vntill the time that the said <i>Iames</i> the Glouer came to him, and this
Examinate then said before the said Glouer, I would to God that I
could drinke, where upon the said Glouer said to this Examinate, take
that drinke, and in the name of the <i>Father</i>, the <i>Sonne</i>, and the
<i>Holy Ghost</i>, drinke it, saying; The Deuill and Witches are not able
to preuaile against <span class="smcap">God</span> and his Word, whereupon this Examinate then
tooke the glasse of drinke, and did drinke it all, and afterwards
mended very well, and so did continue in good health, vntill our Ladie
day in Lent was twelue moneth or thereabouts, since which time this
Examinate saith, that hee hath beene sore pained with great warch in
his bones,<a href="#T3b">[T3<i>b</i>]</a> and all his limmes, and so yet continueth, and this
Examinate further saith, that his said warch and paine came to him
rather by meanes of the said <i>Isabel Robey</i>, then otherwise, as he
verily thinketh.</p>

him whether hee will bee angrie or pleased, for this is my opinion: to
which he answered, when he did need to aske her forgiuenesse, he
would, but hee thought hee did not need, for any thing hee knew: and
yet this Examinate further saith, That the said <i>Peter Chaddock</i> had
very often told her, that he was very afraid that the said <i>Isabel</i>

<p><i>Here is no man aliue more vnwilling to pronounce this wofull and
heauy Iudgement against you, then my selfe: and if it were possible, I
would to God this cup might passe from me. But since it is otherwise
prouided, that after all proceedings of the Law, there must be a
Iudgement; and the Execution of that Iudgement must succeed and follow
in due time: I pray you haue patience to receiue that which the Law
doth lay vpon you. You of all people haue the least cause to
complaine: since in the Triall of your liues there hath beene great
care and paines taken, and much time spent: and very few or none of
you, but stand conuicted vpon your owne voluntarie confessions and
Examinations</i>, Ex ore proprio. <i>Few Witnesses examined against you,
but such as were present, and parties in your Assemblies. Nay I may
further affirme, What persons of your nature and condition, euer were
Arraigned and Tried with more solemnitie, had more libertie giuen to
pleade or answere to euerie particular point of Euidence against you?
In conclusion such hath beene the generall care of all, that had to
deale with you, that you haue neither cause to be offended in the
proceedings of the Iustices, that first tooke paines in these
businesses, nor with the Court that hath had great care to giue
nothing in euidence against you, but matter of fact; Sufficient matter
vpon Record, and not to induce or leade the Iurie to finde any one of
you guiltie vpon matter of suspition or presumption, nor with the
witnesses who haue beene tried, as it were in the fire: Nay, you
cannot denie but must confesse what extraordinarie meanes hath beene
vsed to make triall of their euidence, and to discouer the least
intended practice in any one of them, to touch your liues vniustly.</i></p>

<p><i>As you stand simply (your offences and bloudie practises not
considered) your fall would rather moue compassion, then exasperate
any man. For whom would not the ruine of so many poore creatures at
one time, touch, as in apparance simple, and of little vnderstanding?</i></p>

<p><i>But the bloud of those innocent children, and others his Maiesties
Subiects, whom cruelly and barbarously you haue murdered, and cut off,
with all the rest of your offences, hath cryed out vnto the Lord
against you, and sollicited for satisfaction and reuenge, and that
hath brought this heauie iudgement vpon you at this time.</i></p>

<p><i>It is therefore now time no longer wilfully to striue, both against
the prouidence of God, and the Iustice of the Land: the more you
labour to acquit your selues, the more euident and apparant you make
your offences to the World. And vnpossible it is that they shall
either prosper or continue in this World, or receiue reward in the
next, that are stained with so much innocent bloud.</i></p>

<p><i>The worst then I wish to you, standing at the Barre conuicted, to
receiue your Iudgement, is, Remorse, and true Repentance, for the
safegard of your Soules, and after, an humble, penitent, and heartie
acknowledgement of your grieuous sinnes and offences committed both
against</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>and Man.</i></p>

<p><i>First, yeeld humble and heartie thankes to Almightie</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>for taking
hold of you in your beginning, and making stay of your intended
bloudie practises (although</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>knowes there is too much done
alreadie) which would in time have cast so great a weight of Iudgement
vpon your Soules.</i></p>

<p><i>Then praise</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>that it pleased him not to surprize or strike you
suddenly, euen in the execution of your bloudie Murthers, and in the
middest of your wicked practises, but hath giuen you time, and takes
you away by a iudiciall course and triall of the Law.</i></p>

<p><i>Last of all, craue pardon of the World, and especially of all such as
you haue iustly offended, either by tormenting themselues, children,
or friends, murder of their kinsfolks, or losse of any their goods.</i></p>

<p><i>And for leauing to future times the president of so many barbarous
and bloudie murders, with such meetings, practises, consultations, and
meanes to execute reuenge, being the greatest part of your comfort in
all your actions, which may instruct others to hold the like course,
or fall in the like sort:</i></p>

<p><i>It only remaines I pronounce the Iudgement of the Court against you
by the Kings authoritie, which is;</i> You shall all goe from hence to
the Castle, from whence you came; from thence you shall bee carried to
the place of Execution for this Countie: where your bodies shall bee
hanged vntill you be dead; <span class="smcap">And God Have Mercie Vpon Yovr Sovles</span>; For
your comfort in this world I shall commend a learned and worthie
Preacher to instruct you, and prepare you, for an other World: All I
can doe for you is to pray for your Repentance in this World, for the
satisfaction of many; And forgiuenesse in the next world, for sauing
of your Soules. And God graunt you may make good vse of the time you
haue in this world, to his glorie and your owne comfort.</p>


<h3><i>Margaret Pearson.</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>He Iudgement of the Court against you, is, You shall stand vpon

and <i>Lancaster</i>, foure Market dayes, with a Paper vpon your head, in
great Letters, declaring your offence, and there you shall confesse

It is no part of my profession to publish any thing in print, neither

<p>ANY haue vndertaken to write great discourses of Witches and many
more dispute and speake of them. And it were not much if as many wrote
of them as could write at al, to set forth to the world the particular
Rites and Secrets of their vnlawfull Artes, with their infinite and
wonderfull practises which many men little feare till they seaze vpon

course of life; that I thinke it necessarie not to let the memorie of
her life and death die with her; But to place her next to her fellowes
and to set forth the Arraignement Triall and Conviction of her, with
her offences for which she was condemned and executed.</p>

<p>And although shee died for her offence before the rest, I yet can
afford her no better place then in the end of this Booke in respect
the proceedings was in an other Countie;</p>

<p>You that were husband to this <i>Iennet Preston</i>; her friends and
kinsfolkes, who haue not beene sparing to deuise so scandalous a
slander out of the malice of your hearts, as that shee was maliciously
prosecuted by Master <i>Lister</i> and others; Her life vniustly taken away
by practise; and that (euen at the Gallowes where shee died impenitent
and void of all feare or grace) she died an Innocent woman, because
she would confesse nothing: You I say may not hold it strange, though
at this time, being not only moued in conscience, but directed, for
example sake, with that which I haue to report of her, I suffer you
not to wander any further, but with this short discourse oppose your
idle conceipts able to seduce others: And by Charmes of Imputations
and slander, laid vpon the Iustice of the Land, to cleare her that was
iustly condemned and executed for her offence; That this <i>Iennet
Preston</i> was for many yeares well thought of and esteemed by Master
<i>Lister</i> who afterwards died for it Had free accesse to his house,
kind respect and entertainment; nothing denied her she stood in need
of. Which of you that dwelleth neare them in Crauen but can and will
witnesse it? which might haue incouraged a Woman of any good condition
to haue runne a better course.</p>

<p>The fauour and goodnesse of this Gentleman Master <i>Lister</i> now liuing,
at his first entrance after the death of his Father extended towards
her, and the reliefe she had at all times, with many other fauours
that succeeded from time to time, are so palpable and euident to all
men as no man can denie them. These were sufficient motiues to haue
perswaded her from the murder of so good a friend.</p>

<p>But such was her execrable Ingratitude, as euen this grace and
goodnesse was the cause of his miserable and vntimely death. And euen
in the beginning of his greatest fauours extended to her, began shee
to worke this mischiefe, according to the course of all Witches.</p>

<p>This <i>Iennet Preston</i>, whose Arraignment and Triall, with the
particular Euidence against her I am now to set forth vnto you, one
that liued at Gisborne in Crauen, in the Countie of Yorke, neare
Master <i>Lister</i> of Westbie, against whom she practised much mischiefe;
for hauing cut off <i>Thomas Lister</i> Esquire, father to this gentleman
now liuing,<a href="#Ya1">[Y<i>a</i>1]</a> shee reuenged her selfe vpon his sonne: who in
short time receiued great losse in his goods and cattell by her
meanes.</p>

<p>These things in time did beget suspition, and at the Assizes and
Generall Gaole deliuerie holden at the Castle of Yorke in Lent last
past, before my Lord <i>Bromley</i>, shee was Indicted and Arraigned for
the murder of a Child of one <i>Dodg-sonnes</i>,<a href="#Ya2">[Y<i>a</i>2]</a> but by the fauour
and mercifull consideration of the Iurie thereof acquited.</p>

<p>But this fauour and mercie was no sooner extended towardes her, and
shee set at libertie, But shee began to practise the utter ruine and
ouerthrow of the name and bloud of this Gentleman.</p>

<p>And the better to execute her mischiefe and wicked intent, within
foure dayes after her deliuerance out of the Castle at Yorke, went to
the great Assembly of Witches at <i>Malking-Tower</i> vpon Good-friday
last: to praye aide and helpe, for the murder of Master <i>Lister</i>, in
respect he had prosecuted against her at the same Assizes.</p>

<p>Which it pleased God in his mercie to discouer, and in the end,
howsoeuer he had blinded her, as he did the King of &#198;gypt and his
Instruments, for the brighter euidence of his own powerfull glory: Yet
by a Iudiciall course and triall of the Law, cut her off, and so
deliuered his people from the danger of her Deuilish and wicked
practises: which you shall heare against her, at her Arraignement and
Triall, which I shall now set forth to you in order as it was
performed, with the wonderfull signes and tokens of <span class="smcap">God</span>, to satisfie
the Iurie to finde her guiltie of this bloudie murther, committed
foure yeares since.</p>

<h3>Indictment.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>His <i>Iennet Preston</i> being Prisoner in the Castle at Yorke, and
indicted, for that shee felloniously had practised, vsed, and
exercised diuerse wicked and deuillish Arts, called Witchcrafts,
Inchauntments, Charmes, and Sorceries, in and vpon one <i>Thomas Lister</i>
of Westby in Crauen, in the Countie of Yorke Esquire, and by force of
the same Witchcraft felloniously the said <i>Thomas Lister</i> had killed,
<i>Contra Pacem &amp;c.</i> beeing at the Barre, was arraigned.</p>

<p>To this Indictment vpon her Arraignement, shee pleaded not guiltie,
and for the Triall of her life put her selfe vpon <span class="smcap">God</span> and her
Countrey.</p>

<p>Whereupon my Lord <i>Altham</i> commaunded Master Sheriffe of the Countie
of Yorke, in open Court to returne a Iurie of sufficient Gentlemen of
vnderstanding, to passe betweene our Soueraigne Lord the Kings
Majestie and her, and others the Prisoners, vpon their liues and
deaths; who were afterwards sworne, according to the forme and order
of the Court, the prisoner being admitted to her lawfull challenge.</p>

<p>Which being done, and the Prisoner at the Barre to receiue her Tryall,
Master <i>Heyber</i>,<a href="#Y2a">[Y2<i>a</i>]</a> one of his Maiesties Iustices of Peace in the
same County, hauing taken great paines in the proceedings against her;
and being best instructed of any man of all the particular points of
Euidence against her, humbly prayed, the witnesses hereafter following
might be examined against her, and the seuerall Examinations, taken
before Master <i>Nowel</i>, and certified, might openly bee published
against her; which hereafter follow in order, <i>viz.</i></p>

<h3><i>The Euidence for the Kings Maiestie</i></h3>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Against</b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><span class="smcap">Iennet Preston</span>, <i>Prisoner at the Barre.</i></b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>Ereupon were diuerse Examinations taken and read openly against
her, to induce and satisfie the Gentlemen of the Iurie of Life and
Death, to finde she was a Witch; and many other circumstances for the
death of M. <i>Lister</i>. In the end <i>Anne Robinson</i> and others were both
examined, who vpon their Oathes declared against her, That M. <i>Lister</i>
lying in great extremitie, vpon his death bedde, cried out vnto them
that stood about him; that <i>Iennet Preston</i> was in the house, looke
where shee is, take hold of her: for Gods sake shut the doores, and
take her, shee cannot escape away. Looke about for her, and lay hold
on her, for shee is in the house: and so cryed very often in his great
paines, to them that came to visit him during his sicknesse.</p>


<h3><i>Anne Robinson</i>,</h3>

<h3>and</h3>

<h3><i>Thomas Lister</i>,</h3>

<p>Being examined further, they both gaue this in euidence against her,
That when Master <i>Lister</i> lay vpon his death-bedde, hee cryed out in
great extremitie; <i>Iennet Preston</i> lyes heauie vpon me, <i>Prestons</i>
wife lies heauie vpon me; helpe me, helpe me: and so departed, crying
out against her.</p>

<p>These, with many other witnesses, were further examined, and deposed,
That <i>Iennet Preston</i>, the Prisoner at the Barre, being brought to M.
<i>Lister</i> after hee was dead, &amp; layd out to be wound vp in his
winding-sheet, the said <i>Iennet Preston</i> comming to touch the dead
corpes, they bled fresh bloud presently,<a href="#Y3a">[Y3<i>a</i>]</a> in the presence of all
that were there present: Which hath euer beene held a great argument
to induce a Iurie to hold him guiltie that shall be accused of
Murther, and hath seldome, or neuer, fayled in the Tryall.</p>

<p>But these were not alone: for this wicked and bloud-thirstie Witch was
no sooner deliuered at the Assises holden at Yorke in Lent last past,
being indicted, arraigned, and by the fauor and mercie of the Iurie
found not guiltie, for the murther of a Child by Witch-craft: but vpon
the Friday following, beeing Good-Friday, shee rode in hast to the
great meeting at Malking-Tower, and there prayed aide for the murther
of M. <i>Thomas Lister:</i> as at large shall appeare, by the seuerall
Examinations hereafter following; sent to these Assises from Master
<i>Nowel</i> and other his Maiesties Iustices of Peace in the Countie of

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>His Examinate saith, That vpon Good-Friday last about twelue of
the clocke in the day-time, there dined in this Examinates said
mothers house a number of persons, whereof three were men, with this
Examinate, and the rest women: and that they met there for these three
causes following (as this Examinates said mother told this Examinate):
First was for the naming of the Spirit, which <i>Alizon Deuice</i>, now
Prisoner at Lancaster, had, but did not name him, because shee was not
there. The second cause was for the deliuery of his said Grand-mother,
this Examinates said sister <i>Alizon</i>, the said <i>Anne Chattox</i>, and her
daughter <i>Redferne</i>: Killing the Gaoler at Lancaster; and before the
next Assizes to blow vp the Castle there; to that end the aforesaid
Prisoners might by that meanes make an escape and get away. All which
this Examinate then heard them conferre of. And the third cause was,
for that there was a woman dwelling in Gilburne Parish, who came into
this Examinates said Grand-mothers house, who there came, and craued
assistance of the rest of them that were then there, for the killing
of Master <i>Lister</i> of Westby: because, as she then said, he had borne
malice vnto her, and had thought to haue put her away at the last
Assizes at Yorke; but could not. And then this Examinat heard the said
woman say, that her power was not strong enough to doe it her selfe,
being now lesse then before time it had beene.</p>

<p>And he also further saith, that the said <i>Prestons</i> wife had a Spirit
with her like unto a white Foale, with a blacke-spot in the forehead.
And further, this Examinat saith, That since the said meeting, as
aforesaid, this Examinate hath beene brought to the wife of one
<i>Preston</i> in Gisburne Parish aforesaid, by <i>Henry Hargreiues</i> of
Goldshey, to see whether shee was the woman that came amongst the said
Witches, on the said last Good-Friday, to craue their aide and
assistance for the killing of the said Master <i>Lister</i>: and hauing had
full view of her; hee this Examinate confesseth, That shee was the
selfe-same woman which came amongst the said Witches on the said last
Good-Friday, for their aide for the killing of the said Master
<i>Lister</i>; and that brought the Spirit with her, in the shape of a
White Foale, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>And this Examinate further saith, That all the said Witches went out
of the said house in their owne shapes and likenesses, and they all,
by that they were forth of the doores, were gotten on horse-backe like
vnto Foales, some of one colour, some of another, and <i>Prestons</i> wife
was the last; and when she got on horse-backe, they all presently
vanished out of this Examinats sight: and before their said parting
away, they all appointed to meete at the said <i>Prestons</i> wifes house
that day twelue-month; at which time the said <i>Prestons</i> wife
promised to make them a great feast; and if they had occasion to meet
in the meane time, then should warning bee giuen that they all should
meete vpon Romles-Moore. And this Examinate further saith, That at the
said feast at Malking-Tower, this Examinat heard them all giue their
consents to put the said Master <i>Thomas Lister</i> of Westby to death:
and after Master <i>Lister</i> should be made away by Witchcraft, then al
the said Witches gaue their consents to ioyne altogether to hancke
Master <i>Leonard Lister</i>,<a href="#Za">[Z<i>a</i>]</a> when he should come to dwell at the

<p><img src="images/image47.png" alt="H" width="125" height="125" class="floatl" /></p>

<p>Ere was the wonderfull discouerie of this <i>Iennet Preston</i>, who
for so many yeares had liued at Gisborne in Crauen, neare Master
<i>Lister</i>: one thing more I shall adde to all these particular
Examinations, and euidence of witnesses, which I saw, and was present
in the Court at Lancaster, when it was done at the Assizes holden in
August following.</p>

<p>My Lord <i>Bromley</i> being very suspicious of the accusation of <i>Iennet
Deuice</i>, the little Wench, commanded her to looke vpon the Prisoners
that were present, and declare which of them were present at <i>Malkin
Tower</i>, at the great assembly of Witches vpon Good-Friday last: shee
looked vpon and tooke many by the handes, and accused them to be
there, and when shee had accused all that were there present, shee
told his Lordship there was a Woman that came out of Crauen that was
amongst the Witches at that Feast, but shee saw her not amongst the
Prisoners at the Barre.</p>

<p>What a singular note was this of a Child, amongst many to misse her,
that before that time was hanged for her offence, which shee would
neuer confesse or declare at her death? here was present old <i>Preston</i>
her husband, who then cried out and went away: being fully satisfied
his wife had Iustice, and was worthie of death.</p>

<p>To conclude then this present discourse, I heartilie desire you, my
louing Friends and Countrie-men, for whose particular instructions
this is added to the former of the wonderfull discouerie of Witches in
the Countie of Lancaster: And for whose particular satisfaction this
is published; Awake in time, and suffer not your selues to be thus
assaulted.</p>

<p>Consider how barbarously this Gentleman hath been dealt withall; and
especially you that hereafter shall passe vpon any Iuries of Life and
Death, let not your conniuence, or rather foolish pittie, spare such
as these, to exequute farther mischiefe.</p>

<p>Remember that shee was no sooner set at libertie, but shee plotted the
ruine and ouerthrow of this Gentleman, and his whole Familie.</p>

<p>Expect not, as this reuerend and learned Iudge saith, such apparent
proofe against them, as against others, since all their workes, are
the workes of darkenesse: and vnlesse it please Almightie God to raise
witnesses to accuse them, who is able to condemne them?</p>

<p>Forget not the bloud that cries out vnto God for reuenge, bring it not
vpon your owne heads.</p>

<p>Neither doe I vrge this any farther, then with this, that I would
alwaies intreat you to remember, that it is as great a crime (as
<i>Salomon</i> sayth, <i>Prov.</i> 17.) to condemne the innocent, as to let the
guiltie escape free.</p>

<p>Looke not vpon things strangely alledged, but iudiciously consider
what is justly proued against them.</p>

<p>And that as well all you that were witnesses, present at the
Arraignement and Triall of her, as all other strangers, to whome this
Discourse shall come, may take example by this Gentlemen to prosecute
these hellish Furies to their end:<a href="#Z3b1">[Z3<i>b</i>1]</a> labor to root them out of

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="A1">Dedication</a></span>. &quot;<i>The Right Honorable Thomas Lord Knyvet.</i>&quot;] Sir Thomas
Knivet, or Knyvet, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to James the First,
was afterwards created Baron of Escricke, in the county of York. He it
was who was intrusted to search the vaults under the Parliament House,
and who discovered the thirty-six barrels of gunpowder, and
apprehended Guido Fawkes, who declared to him, that if he had happened
to be within the house when he took him, as he was immediately before,
he would not have failed to blow him up, house and all. (Howell's
<i>State Trials</i>, vol. ii., p. 202.) His courage and conduct on this
occasion seem to have recommended him to the especial favour of James.
Dying without issue, the title of Lord Howard of Escrick was conferred
on Sir Edward Howard, son of Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, who had
married the eldest daughter and co-heir of Sir H. Knivet; and, having
been enjoyed successively by his two sons, ended in his grandson
Charles, in the beginning of the last century. It must be admitted
that the writer has chosen his patron very felicitously. Who so fit to
have the book dedicated to him as one who had acted so conspicuous a
part on the memorable occasion at Westminster? The blowing up of
Lancaster Castle and good Mr. Covel, by the conclave of witches at
Malkin's Tower, was no discreditable imitation of the grand
metropolitan drama on provincial boards.</p>

<p><a name="A2">A 2</a>. <span class="smcap">First Imprimatur</span>. &quot;<i>Ja. Altham, Edw. Bromley.</i>&quot;] These two judges
were Barons of the Court of Exchequer, but neither of them seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have left a name extraordinarily distinguished for legal learning.
Altham was one of the assistants named in the commission for the trial
of the Countess of Somerset for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury in
1616. Bromley appears, from incidental notices contained in the diary
of Nicholas Assheton, (see Whitaker's <i>Whalley</i>, third edition, page
300,) and other sources, to have frequently taken the northern

and correct it.</i>&quot;] This revision by the judge who presided at the
trial gives a singular and unique value and authority to the work. We
have no other report of any witch trial which has an equal stamp of
authenticity. How many of the rhetorical flourishes interspersed in
the book are the property of Thomas Potts, Esquier, and how many are
the interpolation of the &quot;excellent care&quot; of the worthy Baron, it is
scarcely worth while to investigate. Certainly never were judge and
clerk more admirably paired. The <i>Shallow</i> on the bench was well
reflected in the <i>Master Slender</i> below.</p>

<p><a name="Ba">B <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>The number of them being knowen to exceed all others at any

a greater number had been convicted before, even in this country, at
one time, than were found guilty on this occasion, as it appears from
Scot, (<i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i>, page 543, edition 1584,) that
seventeen or eighteen witches were condemned at once, at St. Osith, in
Essex, in 1576, of whom an account was written by Brian Darcy, with
the names and colours of their spirits.</p>

Henry More would have styled old Demdike &quot;An eximious example of
Moses, his Mecassephah, the word which he uses in that law,&#8212;Thou
shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; Margaret Agar and Julian Cox, (see
Glanvill's <i>Collection of Relations</i>, p. 135, edition 1682,) on whom
he dwells with such delighted interest, were very inferior subjects to
what, in his hands, Elizabeth Sothernes would have made. They had
neither of them the finishing attribute of blindness, so fearful in a
witch, to complete the sketch; nor such a fine foreground for the
painting as the forest of Pendle presented; nor the advantage, for
grouping, of a family of descendants in which witchcraft might be
transmitted to the third generation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="B2a">B 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Roger Nowell, Esquire.</i>&quot;] This busy and mischievous
personage who resided at Read Hall, in the immediate neighbourhood of
Pendle, was sheriff of Lancashire in 1610. He married Katherine,
daughter of John Murton, of Murton, and was buried at Whalley, January
31st, 1623. He was of the same family as Alexander Nowell, the Dean of
St. Paul's, and Lawrence Nowell, the restorer of Saxon literature in
England; and tarnished a name which they had rendered memorable, by
becoming, apparently, an eager and willing instrument in that wicked
persecution which resulted in the present trial. His ill-directed
activity seems to have fanned the dormant embers into a blaze, and to
have given aim and consistency to the whole scheme of oppression. From
this man was descended, in the female line, one whose merits might
atone for a whole generation of Roger Nowells, the truly noble-minded
and evangelical Reginald Heber.</p>

<p><a name="B2b2">B 2 <i>b</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>The spirit answered, his name was Tibb.</i>&quot;] Bernard, who
is learned in the nomenclature of familiar spirits, gives, in his
<i>Guide to Grand Jurymen</i>, 1630, 12mo, the following list of the names
of the more celebrated familiars of English witches. &quot;Such as I have
read of are these: Mephistophiles, Lucifer, Little Lord, Fimodes,
David, Jude, Little Robin, Smacke, Litefoote, Nonsuch, Lunch,
Makeshift, Swash, Pluck, Blue, Catch, White, Callico, Hardname, Tibb,
Hiff, Ball, Puss, Rutterkin, Dicke, Prettie, Grissil, and Jacke.&quot; In
the confession of Isabel Gowdie, a famous Scotch witch, (in
<i>Pitcairne's Trials</i>, vol. iii. page 614,) we have the following
catalogue of attendant spirits, rather, it must be confessed, a
formidable band. &quot;The names of our Divellis, that waited upon us, ar
thes: first, Robert the Jakis; Sanderis, the Read Roaver; Thomas the
Fearie; Swain, the Roaring Lion; Thieffe of Hell; Wait upon Hirself;
Mak Hectour; Robert the Rule; Hendrie Laing; and Rorie. We would ken
them all, on by on, from utheris. Some of theim apeirit in sadd dunn,
som in grasse-grein, som in sea-grein, and some in yallow.&quot; Archbishop
Harsnet, in his admirable <i>Declaration of Popish Impostures, under the
pretence of casting out Devils</i>, 1605, 4to, a work unsurpassed for
rich humour and caustic wit, clothed in good old idiomatic English,
has a chapter &quot;on the strange names of these devils,&quot; in which he
observes, (p. 46,) &quot;It is not amiss that you be acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> these
extravagant names of devils, least meeting them otherwise by chance
you mistake them for the names of tapsters, or juglers.&quot; Certainly,
some of the names he marshalls in array smell strongly of the tavern.
These are some of them: Pippin, Philpot, Modu, Soforce, Hilco,
Smolkin, Hillio, Hiaclito, Lustie Huffe-cap, Killico, Hob, Frateretto,
Fliberdigibbet, Hoberdidance, Tocobatto, and Lustie Jollie Jenkin.</p>

<p><a name="B3a1">B 3 <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>The said Deuill did get blood vnder her left arme.</i>&quot;] It
would seem (see Elizabeth Device's Examination afterwards) as if some
preliminary search were made, in the case of this poor old woman, for
the marks which were supposed to come by the sucking or drawing of the
Spirit or Familiar. Most probably her confession was the result of
this and other means of annoyance and torture employed in the usual
unscrupulous manner, upon a blind woman of eighty. Of those marks
supposed to be produced by the sucking of the Spirit or Familiar, the
most curious and scientific (if the word may be applied to such a
subject) account will be found in a very scarce tract, which seems to
have been unknown to the writers on witchcraft. Its title is &quot;A
Confirmation and Discovery of Witchcraft, containing these several
particulars; That there are Witches called bad Witches, and Witches
untruly called good or white Witches, and what manner of people they
be, and how they may be knowne, with many particulars thereunto
tending. Together with the Confessions of many of those executed since
May, 1645, in the several Counties hereafter mentioned. As also some
objections Answered. By John Stearne, now of Lawshall, neere Burie
Saint Edmunds in Suffolke, sometimes of Manningtree in Essex. Prov.
xvii. 15, He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
just, even they both are an abomination to the Lord. Deut. xiii. 14,
Thou shall therefore enquire, and make search, and aske diligently
whether it be truth and the thing certaine. London, Printed by William
Wilson, dwelling in Little Saint Bartholomews, neere Smithfield, 1648,
pages 61, besides preface.&quot; Stearne, in whom Remigius and De Lancre
would have recognized a congenial soul, had a sort of joint commission
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> Hopkins, as Witch-finder, and tells us (see address to Reader)
that he had been in part an agent in finding out or discovering about
200 witches in Essex, Suffolk, Northamptonshire, Huntingtonshire,
Bedfordshire, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and the Isle of Ely. He deals
with the subject undoubtedly like a man whose extensive experience and
practice had enabled him to reduce the matter to a complete system.
(See his account of their marks, pp. 43 to 50.) He might, like John
Kincaid in Tranent, (see Pitcairne's <i>Criminal Trials</i>, vol. iii. p.
599,) have assumed the right of Common Pricker, i.e. Searcher for the
devil's marks, and had his own tests, which were infallible. He
complains, good man, &quot;that in many places I never received penny as
yet, nor any am like, notwithstanding I have hands for satisfaction,
except I should sue; [he should have sued by all means, we might then
have had his bill of particulars, which would have been curious;] but
many rather fall upon me for what hath been received, but I hope such
suits will be disannulled, and that where I have been out of moneys
for Towns in charges and otherwise such course will be taken that I
may be satisfied and paid with reason.&quot; He was doubtless well
deserving of a recompense, and his neighbours were much to blame if he
did not receive a full and ample one. Of the latter end of his
coadjutor, Hopkins, whom Sir Walter Scott (see Somers's Tracts, vol.
iii. p. 97, edit. 1810,) and several other writers represent as
ultimately executed himself for witchcraft, he gives a very different,
and no doubt more correct account; which, singularly enough, has
hitherto remained entirely unnoticed. &quot;He died peaceably at
Manningtree, after a long sicknesse of a consumption, as many of his
generation had done before him, without any trouble of conscience for
what he had done, as was falsely reported of him. He was the son of a
godly minister, and therefore, without doubt, within the Covenant.&quot;
Were not the interests of truth too sacred to be compromised, it might
seem almost a pity to demolish that merited and delightful retribution
which Butler's lines have immortalized.</p>

following extracts from that fine old play, &quot;The Witch of Edmonton,&quot;

Sawyer, in whom the milk of human kindness is turned to gall by
destitution, imbittered by relentless outrage and insult, and who,
driven out of the pale of human fellowship, is thrown upon strange and
fearful allies, would almost appear to be the counterpart of Mother
Demdike. The weird sisters of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> transcendant bard are wild and

<p>None of the offices in the Witches rubric had higher classical warrant
than this method, a favourite one, it appears, of Mother Demdike, but
in which Anne Redfern had the greatest skill of any of these Pendle
witches, of victimizing by moulding and afterwards pricking or burning
figures of clay representing the individual whose life was aimed at.
Horace, Lib. i. Sat. 8, mentions both waxen and woollen images&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lanea et effigies erat altera cerea, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>And it appears from Tacitus, that the death of Germanicus was supposed
to have been sought by similar practices. By such a Simulachrum, or
image, the person was supposed to be devoted to the infernal deities.
According to the Platonists, the effect produced arose from the
operation of the sympathy and synergy of the Spiritus Mundanus, (which
Plotinus calls <span lang="el" title="Greek: ton megan gota; typo &quot;t&quot; for &quot;ton&quot; in original">&#964;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#957; &#947;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#945;</span>, the grand magician,) such as they resolve
the effect of the weaponsalve and other magnetic cures into. The

<div class="blockquot"><p>King James, in his &quot;D&#230;monology,&quot; book ii., chap. 5, tells
us, that &quot;the Devil teacheth how to make pictures of wax or

<p>See also &quot;Grafton's Chronicle,&quot; p. 587, where it is laid to
the charge (among others) of Roger Bolinbrook, a cunning
necromancer, and Margery Jordane, the cunning Witch of Eye,
that they, at the request of Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester,
had devised an image of wax, representing the king, (Henry
the Sixth,) which by their sorcery a little and a little
consumed; intending thereby in conclusion to waste and
destroy the king's person. Shakspeare mentions this, Henry
VI., P. II., act i., sc. 4.</p>

<p>It appears, from Strype's &quot;Annals of the Reformation,&quot;, vol.
i., p. 8, under anno 1558, that Bishop Jewel, preaching
before the queen, said, &quot;It may please your grace to
understand that witches and sorcerers within these few last
years are marvellously increased within your grace's realm.
Your grace's subjects pine away, even unto the death; their
colour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is
benumbed, their senses are bereft. I pray God they never
practise <i>further than upon the subject</i>.&quot; &quot;This,&quot; Strype
adds, &quot;I make no doubt was the occasion of bringing in a
bill, the next parliament, for making enchantments and
witchcraft felony.&quot; One of the bishop's strong expressions
is, &quot;<i>These eyes have seen</i> most evident and manifest marks
of their wickedness.&quot;</p>

<p>It appears from the same work, vol. iv., p. 6, sub anno
1589, that &quot;one Mrs. Dier had practised conjuration against
the queen, to work some mischief to her majesty; for which
she was brought into question: and accordingly her words and
doings were sent to Popham, the queen's attorney, and
Egerton, her solicitor, by Walsingham, the secretary, and
Sir Thomas Heneage, her vice-chamberlain, for their
judgment, whose opinion was that Mrs. Dier was not within
the compass of the statute touching witchcraft, for that she
did no act, and spake certain lewd speeches tending to that
purpose, but neither set figure nor made pictures.&quot; <i>Ibid.</i>,
vol. ii., p. 545, sub anno 1578, Strype says: &quot;Whether it
were the effect of magic, or proceeded from some natural
cause, but the queen was in some part of this year under
excessive anguish <i>by pains of her teeth</i>, insomuch that she
took no rest for divers nights, and endured very great
torment night and day.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrews, in his &quot;Continuation of Henry's History of Great
Britain,&quot; 4to, p. 93, tells us, speaking of Ferdinand, Earl
of Derby, who in the reign of Queen Elizabeth died by
poison, &quot;The credulity of the age attributed his death to
witchcraft. The disease was odd, and operated as a perpetual
emetic; and a <i>waxen image, with hair like that of the
unfortunate earl</i>, found in his chamber, reduced every
suspicion to certainty.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;The wife of Marshal d'Ancre was apprehended, imprisoned,
and beheaded for a witch, upon a surmise that she had
inchanted the queen to dote upon her husband; and they say
the young king's picture was found in her closet, in virgin
wax, with one leg melted away. When asked by her judges what
spells she had made use of to gain so powerful an ascendancy
over the queen, she replied, 'that ascendancy only which
strong minds ever gain over weak ones.'&quot; Seward's &quot;Anecdotes
of some Distinguished Persons,&quot; &amp;c., vol. ii., p. 215.</p>

<p>Blagrave, in his &quot;Astrological Practice of Physick,&quot; p. 89,
observes that &quot;the way which the witches usually take for to
afflict man or beast in this kind is, as I conceive, done by
image or model, made in the likeness of that man or beast
they intend to work mischief upon, and by the subtlety of
the devil made at such hours and times when it shall work
most powerfully upon them, by thorn, pin, or needle, pricked
into that limb or member of the body afflicted.&quot;</p>

<p>Coles, in his &quot;Art of Simpling,&quot; &amp;c., p. 66, says that
witches &quot;take likewise the roots of mandrake, according to
some, or, as I rather suppose, the <i>roots of briony</i>, which
simple folke take for the true mandrake, and make thereof an
ugly image, by which they represent the person on whom they
intend to exercise their witchcraft.&quot; He tells us, <i>ibid.</i>,
p. 26, &quot;Some plants have roots with a number of threads,
like beards, as mandrakes, whereof witches and impostors
make an ugly image, giving it the form of the face at the
top of the root, and leave those strings to make a broad
beard down to the feet.&quot;&#8212;<i>Brand's Antiquities</i>, vol. iii.

<p>Meric Casaubon, who is always an amusing writer, and whose works,
notwithstanding his appetite for the wonderful, do not merit the total
oblivion into which they have fallen, is very angry with Jerome
Cardan, an author not generally given to scepticism, for the
hesitation he displays on the subject of these waxen images:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I know some who question not the power of devils or witches;
yet in this particular are not satisfied how such a thing
can be. For there is no relation or sympathy in nature,
(saith one, who hath written not many years ago,) between a
man and his effigies, that upon the pricking of the one the
other should grow sick. It is upon another occasion that he
speaks it; but his exception reacheth this example equally.
A wonder to me he should so argue, who in many things hath
very well confuted the incredulity of others, though in some
things too credulous himself. If we must believe nothing but
what we can reduce to natural, or, to speak more properly,
(for I myself believe the devil doth very little, but by
nature, though to us unknown,) manifest causes, he doth
overthrow his own grounds, and leaves us but very little of
magical operations to believe. But of all men, Cardan had
least reason to except against this kind of magick as
ridiculous or incredible, who himself is so full of
incredible stories in that kind, upon his own credit alone,
that they had need to be of very easie belief that believe
him, especially when they know (whereof more afterwards)
what manner of man he was. But I dare say, that from Plato's
time, who, among other appurtenances of magic, doth mention
these, <span lang="el" title="Greek: krina mimmata; typo mimkmata for mimmata in original">&#954;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#945;
&#956;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> that is, as
Ovid doth call them, <i>Simulachra cerea</i>, or as Horace,
<i>cereas imagines</i>, (who also in another place more
particularly describes them,) there is not any particular
rite belonging to that art more fully attested by histories
of all ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> than this is. Besides, who doth not know that
it is the devil's fashion (we shall meet with it afterwards
again) to amuse his servants and vassals with many rites and
ceremonies, which have certainly no ground in nature, no
relation or sympathy to the thing, as for other reasons, so
to make them believe, they have a great hand in the
production of such and such effects; when, God knows, many
times all that they do, though taught and instructed by him,
is nothing at all to the purpose, and he, in very deed, is
the only agent, by means which he doth give them no account
of. Bodinus, in his preface to his &quot;D&#230;monology,&quot; relateth,
that three waxen images, whereof one of Queen Elizabeth's,
of glorious memory, and two other, <i>Regin&#230; proximorum</i>, of
two courtiers, of greatest authority under the queen, were
found in the house of a priest at Islington, a magician, or
so reputed, to take away their lives. This he doth repeat
again in his second book, chap. 8, but more particularly
that it was in the year of the Lord 1578, and that Legatus
Angli&#230; and many Frenchmen did divulge it so; but withal, in
both places he doth add, that the business was then under
trial, and not yet perfectly known. I do not trust my
memory: I know my age and my infirmities. Cambden, I am
sure, I have read; and read again; but neither in him, nor
in Bishop Carleton's &quot;Thankful Remembrancer,&quot; do I remember
any such thing. Others may, perchance. Yet, in the year
1576, I read in both of some pictures, representing some
that would have kill'd that glorious queen with a motto,
<i>Quorsum h&#230;c, alio properantibus!</i> which pictures were made
by some of the conspiracy for their incouragement; but
intercepted, and showed, they say, to the queen. Did the
time agree, it is possible these pictures might be the
ground of those mistaken, if mistaken, waxen images, which I
desire to be taught by others who can give a better
account.&#8212;<i>Casaubon's (M.) Treatise, proving Spirits,
Witches, and Supernatural Operations</i>, 1672. 12mo., p. 92.</p></div>

<p>In Scotland this practice was in high favour with witches, both in
ancient and modern times. The lamentable story of poor King Duff, as
related by Hector Boethius, a story which has blanched the cheek and
spoiled the rest of many a youthful reader, is too well known to need
extracting. Even so late as 1676, Sir George Maxwell, of Pollock, (See
Scott's <i>Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft</i>, p. 323,) apparently a
man of melancholy and valetudinarian habits, believed himself
bewitched to death by six witches, one man and five women, who were
leagued for the purpose of tormenting a clay image in his likeness.
Five of the accused were executed, and the sixth only escaped on
account of extreme youth.</p>

<p>Isabel Gowdie, the famous Scotch witch before referred to, in her
confessions gives a very particular account of the mode in which these
images were manufactured. It is curious, and worth quoting:&#8212;</p>

<p><a name="B4b1">B 4 <i>b</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>And sayd that she should haue gould, siluer, and worldly
wealth at her will.</i>&quot;] These familiars, to use Warburton's expression,
always promised with the lavishness of a young courtier, and performed
with the indifference of an old one. Nothing seems to puzzle Dr. Dee
more, in the long and confidential intercourse he carried on so many
years with his spirits, than to account for the great scarcity of
specie they seemed to be afflicted with, and the unsatisfactory and
unfurnished state of their exchequer. Bills, to be sure, they gave at
long dates; but these constantly required renewing, and were never
honoured at last. Any application for present relief, in good current
coin of the realm, was invariably followed by what Meric Casaubon very
significantly calls &quot;sermonlike stuff.&quot; The learned professor in
witchery, John Stearne, seems to fix six shillings as the maximum of
money payment at one time which in all his experience he had detected
between witches and their familiars. He was examining Joan Ruccalver,
of Powstead, in Suffolk, who had been promised by her spirit that she
should never want meat, drink, clothes, or money. &quot;Then I asked her
whether they brought her any money or no; and she said sometimes four
shillings at a time, and sometimes six shillings at a time; but that
is but seldom, <i>for I never knew any that had any money before</i>,
except of Clarke's wife, of Manningtree, who confessed the same, and
showed some, which, she said, her impe brought her, which was proper
money.&quot; Confirmation, page 27. Judging from the anxiety which this
worthy displays to be &quot;satisfied and paid with reason&quot; for his
itinerant labours, such a scanty and penurious supply would soon have
disgusted him, if he had been witch, instead of witch-finder.</p>

<p><a name="B4b2">B 4 <i>b</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>She had bewitched to death Richard Ashton, sonne of
Richard Ashton, of Downeham, Esquire.</i>&quot;] Richard Assheton, (as the
name is more properly spelled,) thus done to death by witchcraft, was
the son of Richard Assheton, of Downham, an old manor house, the scite
of which is now supplied by a modern structure, which Dr. Whitaker
thinks, in point of situation, has no equal in the parish of Whalley.
Richard, the son, married Isabel, daughter and heiress of Mr. Hancock,
of Pendleton Hall, and died without offspring. The family estate
accordingly descended to the younger brother, Nicholas Assheton, whose
diary for part of the year 1617 and part of the year following is
given, page 303 of Whitaker's <i>History of Whalley</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> edition 1818, and
is a most valuable record of the habits, pursuits, and course of life
of a Lancashire country gentleman of that period. It well deserves
detaching in a separate publication, and illustrating with a more
expanded commentary.</p>

liquor with.</p>

<p><a name="C2a">C 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Nicholas Banister.</i>&quot;] Dr. Whitaker, in the pedigree of the
Banisters, of Altham, (genealogy was, it is well known, one of the
vulnerable parts of this Achilles of topography,) erroneously states
this Nicholas Banister to have been buried at Altham, December 7,
1611. It appears, however, from a deed, an inspection of which I owe
to the kindness of my friend, Dr. Fleming, that his will was dated the
15th August, 1612. In all probability he did not die for some years
after that date. He married, first, Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of
Richard Elston, of Brockall, Esq.; and, second, Catherine, daughter of
Edmund Ashton, of Chaderton, Esq. The manor house of Altham, for more
than five centuries the residence of this ancient family, stands, to
use Dr. Whitaker's words, upon a gentle elevation on the western side
of the river Calder, commanding a low and fertile domain. It has been
surrounded, according to the prudence or jealousy of the feudal times,
with a very deep quadrangular moat, which must have included all the
apparatus of the farm.</p>

<p><a name="C3a">C 3 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>At Malking Tower, in the forrest of Pendle.</i>&quot;] Malkin Tower
was the habitation of Mother Demdike, the situation of which is
preserved, for the structure no longer exists, by local tradition.
Malkin is the Scotch or north country word for hare, as this animal
was one into which witches were supposed to be fond of transforming
themselves. Malkin Tower is, in fact, the Witches' Tower. The term is
used in the following passage in Morison's <i>Poems</i>, p. 7, which bears
upon the above explanation:&#8212;</p>

<p><a name="C4b">C 4 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>We want old Demdike, who dyed in the castle before she came
to her tryall.</i>&quot;] Worn out most probably with her imprisonment, she
having been committed in April, and the cruelties she had undergone,
both before and after her commitment. Master Nowell and Master Potts
both <i>wanted</i> her, we may readily conceive, to fill up the miserable
pageant; but she was gone where the wicked cease from troubling, and
the weary are at rest. With the exception of Alice Nutter, in whom
interest is excited from very different grounds, Mother Demdike
attracts attention in a higher degree than any other of these Pendle
witches. She was, beyond dispute, the Erictho of Pendle. Mother
Chattox was but second in rank. There is something fearfully intense
in the expression of the former,&#8212;blind, on the last verge of the
extreme limit of human existence, and mother of a line of
witches,&#8212;&quot;that she would pray for the said Baldwin, both still and
loud.&quot; She is introduced in Shadwell's play, the <i>Lancashire Witches</i>,
1682, as a <i>persona dramatis</i>, along with Mother Dickinson and Mother
Hargrave, two of the witches convicted in 1633, but without any regard
to the characteristic circumstances under which she appears in the
present narrative. The following invocation, which is put into her
mouth, is rather a favourable specimen of that play, certainly not one
of the worst of Shadwell's, in which there are many vigorous strokes,
with an alloy of coarseness not unusual in his works, and some
powerful conceptions of character:</p>

period, as deputy steward at Clitheroe. (See Whitaker's <i>Whalley</i>, p.

<p><a name="D4a">D 4 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>One Mr. Baldwyn (the late Schoole-maister at Coulne) did by
his learning, stay the sayd Loomeshaws wife, and therefore had a Capon
from Redfearne.</i>&quot;] I regret that I can give no account of this learned
Theban, who appears to have stayed the plague, and who taught at the
school at which Archbishop Tillotson was afterwards educated. He well
deserved his capon. Had he continued at Colne up to the time of this
trial, he might perhaps, on the same easy terms, have kept the powers
of darkness in check, and prevented some imputed crimes which cost ten
unfortunates their lives.</p>

<p><a name="Eb1">E <i>b</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Iames Robinson.</i>&quot;] Baines, in his <i>History of Lancashire</i>,
vol. i. p. 605, speaks of Edmund Robinson, the father of the boy on
whose evidence the witches were convicted in 1633, as if he had been a
witness at the present trial; which is probably a mistake for this
James Robinson, as no Edmund Robinson appears amongst the witnessses
whose depositions are given.</p>

<p><a name="Eb2">E <i>b</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Anne Whittle alias Chattox was hired by this examinates
wife to card wooll.</i>&quot;] She seems to have been by occupation a carder
of wool, and to have filled up the intervals, when she had no
employment, by mendicancy.</p>

<p><a name="E2a">E 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Sir Richard Shuttleworth.</i>&quot;} Of the family of the
Shuttleworths of Gawthorp, &quot;where they resided&quot; Whitaker observes, &quot;in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> condition of inferior gentry till the lucrative profession of the
law raised them, in the reign of Elizabeth, to the rank of knighthood
and an estate proportioned to its demands.&quot; Sir Richard was
Sergeant-at-law, and Chief Justice of Chester, 31st Elizabeth, and
died without issue about 1600.</p>

<p><a name="E2b">E 2 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>A Charme.</i>&quot;] Evidently in so corrupted a state as to bid
defiance to any attempt at elucidation.</p>

<p><a name="E3a1">E 3 <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Perceiuing Anthonie Nutter of Pendle to fauour Elizabeth
Sothernes alias Dembdike.</i>&quot;] The Sothernes and Davies's and the
Whittles and Redfernes were the Montagus and Capulets of Pendle. The
poor cottager whose drink was forsepoken or bewitched, or whose cow
went mad, and who in his attempt to propitiate one of the rival powers
offended the other, would naturally exclaim from the innermost
recesses of his heart, &quot;A plague on both your houses.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="E3a2">E 3 <i>a</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Gaping as though he would haue wearied this Examinate.</i>&quot;]
Wearied for worried.</p>

<p><a name="E3b">E 3 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>Examination of Iames Device.</i>&quot;] This is a very curious
examination. The production of the four teeth and figure of clay dug
up at the west-end of Malkin Tower would look like a &quot;damning witness&quot;
to the two horror-struck justices and the assembled concourse at Read,
who did not perhaps consider how easily such evidences may be
furnished, and how readily they who hide may find. The incident
deposed to at the burial at the New Church in Pendle is a wild and
striking one.</p>

<p><a name="E4a">E 4 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>About eleuen yeares agoe, this Examinate and her mother had
their firehouse broken.</i>&quot;] The inference intended is, that Whittle's
family committed the robbery from Old Demdike's house. This was, in
all probability, the origin of their feuds. The abstraction of the
coif and band, tempting articles to the young daughter of Old Chattox,
not destitute, if we may judge from one occurrence deposed to, of
personal attractions, may be said to have convulsed Lancashire from
the Leven to the Mersey,&#8212;to have caused a sensation, the shock of
which, after more than two centuries, has scarcely yet subsided, and
to have actually given a new name to the fair sex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="E4b1">E 4 <i>b</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>One Aghen-dole of meale.</i>&quot;] This Aghen-dole, a word
still, I believe, in use for a particular measure of any article, was,
I presume, a kind of witches' black mail. My friend, the Rev. Canon
Parkinson, informs me that Aghen-dole, sometimes pronounced
Acken-dole, signifies an half-measure of anything, from
half-hand-dole. Mr. Halliwell has omitted it in his Glossary, now in
progress.</p>

<p><a name="E4b2">E 4 <i>b</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Iohn Moore of Higham, Gentleman.</i>&quot;] Sir Jonas Moore, of
whom an account is contained in Whitaker's <i>Whalley</i>, p. 479, and whom
he characterizes as a sanguine projector, was born in Pendle Forest,
and was probably of this family.</p>

<p><a name="E4b3">E 4 <i>b</i> 3</a>. &quot;<i>She would meet with the said Iohn Moore, or his.</i>&quot;] i.e.
She would be equal with him.</p>

<p><a name="Fa1">F <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Charne.</i>&quot;] i.e. Charm.</p>

<p><a name="Fa2">F <i>a</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>With weeping teares she humbly acknowledged them to be
true.</i>&quot;] She seems to have confessed in the hope of saving her
daughter, Anne Redfern. But from such a judge as Sir Edward Bromley,
mercy was as little to be expected as common sense from his &quot;faithful
chronicler,&quot; Thomas Potts.</p>

<p><a name="F2b">F 2 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>Sparing no man with fearefull execrable curses and
banning.</i>&quot;] Nothing seems to shock the nerves of these witch
historiographers so much as the utter want of decorum and propriety
exhibited by these unhappy creatures in giving vent to these indignant
outbreaks, which a sense of the wicked injustice of their fate, and
seeing their own offspring brought up in evidence against them,
through the most detestable acts, and by the basest subornation, would
naturally extort from minds even of iron mould. If ever Lear's or
Timon's power of malediction could be justifiably called into
exercise, it would be against such a tribunal and such witnesses as
they had generally to encounter.</p>

<p><a name="F4a">F 4 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>That at the third time her Spirit.</i>&quot;] Something seems to be
wanting here, as she does not state what occurred at the two previous
interviews. The learned judge may have exercised a sound discretion in
this omission, as the particulars might be of a nature unfit for
publication. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> present tract is, undoubtedly, remarkably free from
those disgusting details of which similar reports are generally full
to overflowing.</p>

<p><a name="F4b">F 4 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>The said Iennet Deuice, being a yong Maide, about the age
of nine yeares.</i>&quot;] This child must have been admirably trained, (some
Master Thomson might have been near at hand to instruct her,) or must
have had great natural capacity for deception. She made an excellent
witness on this occasion. What became of her after the wholesale
extinction of her family, to which she was so mainly instrumental, is
not now known. In all likelihood she dragged on a miserable existence,
a forlorn outcast, pointed at by the hand of scorn, or avoided with
looks of horror in the wilds of Pendle. As if some retributive
punishment awaited her, she is reported to have been the Jennet Davies
who was condemned in 1633, on the evidence of Edmund Robinson the
younger, with Mother Dickenson and others, but not executed. Her
confession, if she made one at the second trial, might not have been
unsimilar to that of Alexander Sussums, of Melford in Suffolk, who,
Hearne tells us, confessed &quot;that he had things which did draw those
marks I found upon him, but said he could not help it, for that all
his kinred were naught. Then I asked him how it was possible they
could suck without his consent. He said he did consent to that. Then I
asked him again why he should do it when as God was so merciful
towards him, as I then told him of, being a man whom I had been
formerly acquainted withal, as having lived in town. He answered
again, he could not help it, for that all his generation was naught;
and so told me <i>his mother and aunt were hanged, his grandmother burnt
for witchcraft, and ten others of them questioned and hanged</i>. This
man is yet living, notwithstanding he confessed the sucking of such
things above sixteen years together.&quot;&#8212;<i>Confirmation</i>, p. 36.</p>

This meeting, if not a witches' Sabbath, was a close approximation to
one. On the subject of the Sabbath, or periodical meeting of witches,
De Lancre is the leading authority. He who is curious cannot do better
than consult this great hierophant, (his work is entitled Tableau de
l'Inconstance des mauvais Anges et Demons. Paris, 1613, 4to.) whose
knowledge and experience well qualified him to have been constituted
the Itinerant Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> of Ceremonies, an officer who, he assures us,
was never wanting on such occasions. In that singular book, <i>The
History of Monsieur Oufle</i>, p. 288, (English Translation, 1711, 8vo.)
are collected from various sources all the ceremonies and
circumstances attending the holding the Sabbath. It appears that
non-attendance invariably incurred a penalty, which is computed upon
the average at the eighth part of a crown, or in French currency at
ten sous&#8212;that, though the contrary has been maintained by many grave
authors, egress and ingress by the chimney (De Lancre had depositions
without number, he tells us, <i>vide</i> p. 114, on this important head,)
was not a matter of solemn obligation, but was an open question&#8212;that
no grass ever grows upon the place where the Sabbath is kept; which is
accounted for by the circumstance of its being trodden by so many of
those whose feet are constitutionally hot, and therefore being burnt
up and consequently very barren&#8212;that two devils of note preside on
the occasion, the great negro, who is called Master Leonard, and a
little devil, whom Master Leonard sometimes substitutes in his place
as temporary vice-president; his name is Master John Mullin. (De
Lancre, p. 126.) With regard to a very important point, the bill of
fare, great difference of opinion exists: some maintaining that every
delicacy of the season, to use the newspaper phrase, is provided;
others stoutly asserting that nothing is served up but toads, the
flesh of hanged criminals, dead carcases fresh buried taken out of
Churchyards, flesh of unbaptized infants, or beasts which died of
themselves&#8212;that they never eat with salt, and that their bread is of
black millet. (De Lancre, pp. 104, 105.) In this diversity of opinion
I can only suggest, that difference of climate, habit, and fashion,
might possibly have its weight, and render a very different larder
necessary for the witches of Pendle and those of Gascony or Lorrain.
The fare of the former on this occasion appears to have been of a very
substantial and satisfactory kind, &quot;beef, bacon, and roasted mutton:&quot;
the old saying so often quoted by the discontented masters of
households applying emphatically in this case:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;God sends us good meat, but the devil sends cooks.&quot;</p></div>

<p>We find in the present report no mention made of the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Dance and provencal song&quot;</p></div>

<p>which formed one great accompaniment of the orgies of the southern
witches. Bodin's authority is express, that each, the oldest not
excused, was expected to perform a coranto, and great attention was
paid to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> regularity of the steps. We owe to him the discovery,
which is not recorded in any annals of dancing I have met with, that
the lavolta, a dance not dissimilar, according to his description, to
the polka of the present day, was brought out of Italy into France by
the witches at their festive meetings. Of the language spoken at these
meetings, De Lancre favours us with a specimen, valuable, like the
Punic fragment in the P&#339;nolus, for its being the only one of the
kind. <i>In nomine patrica araguenco petrica agora, agora, Valentia
jouando goure gaiti goustia.</i> As it passes my skill, I can only
commend it to the especial notice of Mr. Borrow against his next
journey into Spain. What was spoken at Malkin Tower was, doubtless, a
dialect not yet obsolete, and which Tummus and Meary would have had no
difficulty in comprehending. On the subject of these witches'
Sabbaths, Dr. Ferriar remarks, in his curious and agreeable <i>Essay on
Popular Illusions</i>, (see <i>Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and
Philosophical Society</i>, vol. iii., p. 68,) a sketch which it is much
to be regretted that he did not subsequently expand and revise, and
publish in a separate form:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The solemn meetings of witches are supposed to be put beyond
all doubt by the numerous confessions of criminals, who have
described their ceremonies, named the times and places of
meeting, and the persons present, and who have agreed in
their relations, though separately delivered.<a name="FNanchor_78_82" id="FNanchor_78_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_82" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But I
would observe, first, that the circumstances told of those
festivals are ridiculous and incredible in themselves; for
they are represented as gloomy and horrible, yet with a
mixture of childish and extravagant fancies, more likely to
disgust and alienate than to conciliate the minds of the
guests. They have every appearance of uneasy dreams;
sometimes the devil and his subjects <i>say mass</i>, sometimes
he <i>preaches</i> to them, more commonly he was seen in the form
of a black goat, surrounded by imps in a thousand frightful
shapes; but none of these forms are <i>new</i>, they all resemble
known quadrupeds or reptiles. Secondly, I observe, that
there is direct proof furnished even by demonologists, that
all these supposed journies and entertainments are nothing
more than dreams. Persons accused of witchcraft have been
repeatedly watched, about the time which they had fixed for
the meeting; they have been seen to anoint themselves with
soporific compositions, after which they fell into profound
sleep, and on awaking, several hours afterwards, they have
related their journey through the air, their amusement at
the festival, and have named the persons whom they saw
there. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> the instance told by Hoffman, the dreamer was
chained to the floor. Common sense would rest satisfied
here, but the enthusiasm of demonology has invented more
than one theory to get rid of these untoward facts. Dr.
Henry More, as was formerly mentioned, believed that the
astral spirit only was carried away: other demonologists
imagined that the witch was really removed to the place of
meeting, but that a cacodemon was left in her room, as an
<span lang="el" title="Greek: eidlon">&#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>, to delude the spectators. Thirdly, some
stories of the festivals are evidently tricks. Such is that
related by Bodinus, with much gravity: a man is found in a
gentleman's cellar, and apprehended as a thief; he declares
his wife had brought him thither to a witch-meeting, and on
his pronouncing the name of God, she and all her companions
had vanished, and left him inclosed. His wife is immediately
seized, on this righteous evidence, and hanged, with several
other persons, named as present at the meeting.</p></div>

witches' solemn meetings: &quot;If the witch be outwardly Christian,
baptism must be renounced, and the party must be rebaptized in the
Devil's name, and a new name is also imposed by him; and here must be
godfathers too, for the Devil takes them not to be so adult as to
promise and vow for themselves.&quot; (<i>Cases of Conscience touching
Witches</i>, page 59. 1646, 12mo.) But Gaule does not mention any naming
or baptism of spirits and familiars on such occasions.</p>

Pitiable, truly, was the situation of this unhappy wretch. Brought out
from the restraint of a long imprisonment, before and during which he
had, as we may conjecture, been subjected to every inhumanity, in a
state more dead than alive, into a court which must have looked like
one living mass, with every eye lit up with horror, and curses, not
loud but deep, muttered with harmonious concord from the mouths of
every spectator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

Would this be Anne, the daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Catterall,
of Catterall and Little Mitton, Esq., who married Henry Townley, the
son of Lawrence Townley? (See Whitaker's <i>Whalley</i>, p. 396.) The
Townleys of Barnside and Carr were a branch of the Townleys, of
Townley. Barnside, or Barnsete, is an ancient mansion in the township
of Colne, which, Whitaker observes, was abandoned by the family, for
the warmer situation of Carr, about the middle of the last century.</p>

examination of Mr. Townley, the husband of the lady whose life was
said to have been taken away by witchcraft. The examinations given in
this tract are altogether those of persons in a humble rank of life.
The contrast between their evidence and that of an individual
occupying the position of the descendant of one of the oldest families
in the neighbourhood, with considerable landed possessions, might have
been amusing and instructive.</p>

<p>which lines are not unlike some of those in the present &quot;charme,&quot;
which, evidently much corrupted by recitation, is a very singular and
interesting string of fragments handed down from times long anterior
to the Reformation, when they had been employed as armour of proof by
the credulous vulgar against the Robin Goodfellows, urchins, elves,
hags, and fairies of earlier superstition. I regret that I cannot
throw more light upon it. The concluding lines are not deficient in

craske, <i>Delicativus</i>, crassus, I am unable to conjecture. It is
clear, that the wand in one hand is to steck, <i>i.e.</i> stake, or fasten,
the latch of hell door, while the key in his other hand is to open
heaven's lock.</p>

Romish Church, was used in that sacrament. If the child died within a
month of its birth, that cloth was used as a shroud; and children so

<p><a name="K3a">K 3 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>The Witches of Salmesbvry.</i>&quot;] Or, more properly,
Samlesbury. This wicked attempt on the part of this priest, or Jesuit,
Thompson, <i>alias</i> Southworth, to murder the three persons whose trial
is next reported, by suborning a child of the family to accuse them of
what, in the excited state of the public mind at the time, was almost
certain to consign them to a public execution, has few parallels in
the annals of atrocity. The plot was defeated, and the lives of the
persons accused, Jennet Bierley, Ellen Bierley, and Jane Southworth,
saved, by no sagacity of the judge or wisdom of the jury, but by the
effect of one simple question, wrung from the intended victims on the
verge of anticipated condemnation, and which, natural as it might
appear, was one the felicity of which Garrow or Erskine might have
envied. It demolished, like Ithuriel's spear, the whole fabric of
imposture, and laid it open even to the comprehension of Sir Edward
Bromley and Master Thomas Potts. This was a case which well deserved
Archbishop Harsnet for its historian. His vein of irony, which Swift
or Echard never surpassed, and the scorching invective of which he was
so consummate a master, would have been well employed in handing down
to posterity a scene of villainy to which the frauds of Somers and the
stratagems of Weston were mere child's play. We might then have had,
from the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> enlightened man of his age, a commentary on the statute
1st James First, which would have neutralized its mischief, and spared
a hecatomb of victims. His resistless ridicule would, perhaps, have
accomplished at once what was slowly and with difficulty brought about
by the arguments of Scot and Webster, the establishment of the Royal
Society, and a century's growth of intelligence and knowledge.</p>

an ancient family in Lancashire, and who was executed at Tyburn, June
28th, 1655. His dying speech is to be found in the same volume, p.
360. The interval of time, as well as the difference of surname,
excludes the presumption of his being identical with the person

the centre of very high antiquity, probably not later than Edward III;
and observes, &quot;There is about the house a profusion and bulk of oak
that must almost have laid prostrate a forest to erect it.&quot;</p>

woman seems to have been regularly hunted to death by her prosecutors,
who pursued her with all the dogged pertinacity of blood-hounds.
Neither the imploring appeal for mercy, in her case, from her wretched
mother, who did not ask for any in her own, nor the want of even the
shadow of a ground for the charge, had the slightest effect upon the
besotted prejudices of the judge and jury. Acquitted on one
indictment, she is now put on her trial on another; the imputed crime
being her having caused the death of a person, who did not even accuse
her of being accessory to it, nearly eighteen years before, by
witchcraft; the only evidence, true or false, being, that she had been
seen, about the same period, making figures of clay or marl. Her real
offence, it may well be conjectured, was her having rejected the
improper advances of the ill-conditioned young man whose death she was
first indicted for procuring, and to which circumstance the rancour of
his relations, the prosecutors, may evidently be traced. It is
gratifying to know that she had firmness of mind to persist in the
declaration of her innocence to the last.</p>

<p><a name="O3a">O 3 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Alice Nutter.</i>&quot;] We now come to a person of a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
description from any of those who have preceded as parties accused,
and on whose fate some extraordinary mystery seems to hang. Alice
Nutter was not, like the others, a miserable mendicant, but was a lady
of large possessions, of a respectable family, and with children whose
position appears to have been such as, it might have been expected,
would have afforded her the means of escaping the fate which overtook
her humbler companions.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I knew her a good woman and well bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an unquestion'd carriage, well reputed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst her neighbours, reckoned with the best.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Heywood's Lancashire Witches.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She is described as the wife of Richard Nutter of the Rough Lee, and
mother of Miles Nutter, who were in all likelihood nearly related to
the other Nutters whose descent has been given. The tradition is, that
she was closely connected by relationship or marriage with Eleanor
Nutter, the daughter of Ellis Nutter of Pendle Forest, the grandmother
of Archbishop Tillotson. That she was the victim of a foul and
atrocious conspiracy, in which the movers were some of her own family,
there seems no reason to doubt. The anxiety of her children to induce
her to confess may possibly have originated in no impure or sinister
motive, but it is difficult altogether to dismiss from the mind the
suspicion that her wealth was her great misfortune; and that to secure
it within their grasp her own household were passive, if not active,
agents in her destruction. Any thing more childish or absurd than the
evidence against her&#8212;as, for instance, that she joyned in killing
Henry Mitton because he refused a penny to Old Demdike&#8212;it would not
be easy, even from the records of witch trials, to produce. As regards
Alice Nutter, Potts is singularly meagre, and it is to be lamented
that the deficiency of information cannot at present be supplied.
Almost the only fact he furnishes us with is, that she died
maintaining her innocence. It would have been most interesting to have
had the means of ascertaining how she conducted herself at her trial
and after her condemnation; and how she met the iniquitous injustice
of her fate, sharpened, as it must have been, by the additional
bitterness of the insults and execrations of the blind and infuriated
populace at her execution. It is far from improbable that some of the
correspondence now deposited in the family archives in the county
hitherto unpublished may ultimately furnish these particulars.</p>

<p>Alice Nutter was doubtless the original of the story of which Heywood
availed himself in <i>The Late Lancashire Witches</i>, 1634, 4to, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
frequently noticed by the writers of the 17th century&#8212;that the wife
of a Lancashire country gentleman had been detected in practising
witchcraft and unlawful arts, and condemned and executed. In that play
there can be little hesitation in ascribing to Heywood the scenes in
which Mr. Generous and his wife are the interlocutors, and to Broome,
Heywood's coadjutor, the subordinate and farcical portions. It is a
very unequal performance, but not destitute of those fine touches,
which Heywood is never without, in the characters of English country
gentlemen and the pathos of domestic tragedy. The following scene,
which I am tempted to extract, though very inferior to the noble ones
in his <i>Woman Killed by Kindness</i>, between Mr. and Mrs. Frankford,
which it somewhat resembles in character, is not unworthy of this
great and truly national dramatic writer:&#8212;</p>

<p><a name="P2a1">P 2 <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Being examined by my Lord.</i>&quot;] She had evidently learned
her lesson well; but this was, with all submission to his Lordship, if
adopted as a test, a mighty poor one. Jennet Device must have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
well the persons of the parties she accused, and who were now upon
their trial, as they were all her near neighbours.</p>

<p><a name="P2a2">P 2 <i>a</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Whether she knew Iohan a Style?</i>&quot;] His Lordship's
introduction of this apocryphal legal personage on such an occasion is
very amusing. Had he studied Littleton and Perkins a little less, and
given some attention to the Lancashire dialect, and some also to the
study of that great book, in which even a judge may find valuable
matter, the book of human nature, he might have been more successfull
in his examination. Jack's o' Dick's o' Harry's would have been more
likely to have been recognised as a veritable person of this world by
Jennet Device, than such a name as Johan a Style; which, though very
familiar at Westminster, would scarcely have its prototype at Pendle.
But Jennet Device, young as she was, in natural shrewdness was far
more than a match for his lordship.</p>

<p><a name="P3a">P 3 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Katherine Hewit, alias Movld-heeles.</i>&quot;] Of this person, who
comes next in the list of witches, our information is very scanty. She
was not of Pendle, but of Colne; and as her husband is described as a
&quot;clothier,&quot; may be presumed to have been in rather better
circumstances than Elizabeth Southernes or Anne Whittle's families.
She made no confession.</p>

<p><a name="P4a1">P 4 <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Anne Foulds of Colne. Michael Hartleys of Colne.</i>&quot;] Folds
and Hartley are still the names of families at and in the
neighbourhood of Colne.</p>

<p><a name="P4a2">P 4 <i>a</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Had then in hanck a child.</i>&quot;] The meaning of this term is
clear, the origin rather dubious. It may come from the Scotch word,
<i>to hanck</i>, i.e. to have in holdfast or secure, vide Jamieson's Scotch
Dictionary, tit. hanck, or from handkill, to murder, vide Jamieson,
under that word; or lastly, may be metaphorically used, from hanck,
also signifying a skein of yarn or worsted which is tied or trussed
up.</p>

<p><a name="Q2a">Q 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Iohn Bulcocke, Iane Bulcocke his mother.</i>&quot;] The condition
of these persons is not stated. It may be conjectured that they were
of the lowest class.</p>

<p><a name="Q3a1">Q 3 <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>At the Barre hauing formerly confessed.</i>&quot;] Why is not
their confession given?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Q3a2">Q 3 <i>a</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Crying out in very violent and outrageous manner, even to
the gallowes.</i>&quot;] The latter end of these unfortunate people was
perhaps similar to that of Isobel Crawford, executed in Scotland the
year after for witchcraft, who, on being sentenced, openly denied all
her former confessions, and died without any sign of repentance,
offering repeated interruption to the minister in his prayer, and
refusing to pardon the executioner.</p>

<p><a name="Q4a">Q 4 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Master Thomas Lister of Westby.</i>&quot;] See note on p.
<a href="#Ya1">Y <i>a</i></a>.</p>

<p><a name="Q4b">Q 4 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>The said Bulcockes wife doth know of some Witches to bee

of two poor creatures into jeopardy.</p>

<p><a name="Ra">R <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Accused the said Iohn Bulcock to turne the Spitt there.</i>&quot;]
What a fact this would have been for De Lancre. With all his accurate
statistics on the subject of the witches' Sabbath, he was not aware
that a turnspit was a necessary officer on such occasions, as well as
a master of ceremonies. This artful and well instructed jade, Jennet
Device, must have borne especial malice against John Bulcock.</p>

<p><a name="R1b">R 1 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>The names of the Witches at the Great Assembly and Feast at
Malking-Tower, viz. vpon Good-Friday last, 1612.</i>&quot;] In this list of
fourteen individuals, Master Potts has omitted &quot;the painful steward so
careful to provide mutton,&quot; James Device, who made up the number to
fifteen. Of these persons seven were not indicted: Jennet Hargraves,
the wife of Hugh Hargraves, of Barley under Pendle; Elizabeth
Hargraves, the wife of Christopher Hargraves; Christopher Howgate, the
son of Old Demdike; Christopher Hargraves, who is described as of
Thurniholme, or Thornholme, and as Christopher o' Jacks, and was
husband of Elizabeth Hargraves; Grace Hay, of Padiham; Anne Crunkshey,
of Marchden, or more properly, Cronkshaw of Marsden; and Elizabeth
Howgate, the wife of Christopher Howgate. The two Howgates were, it
may be, the &quot;one Holgate and his wife,&quot; mentioned in Robinson's
deposition in 1633. Alice Graie, or Gray, included in the list, was
indicted, though no copy of the indictment is afforded by Potts, and,
singular as it may seem, acquitted. Richard Miles' wife, of the Rough
Lee, stated to have been present in some of the depositions, (<a href="#G3b1">G 3
<i>b</i></a>,) was, beyond doubt, Alice Nutter, so called as the wife of
Richard and mother of Miles Nutter.</p>

<p>It may afford matter for speculation, whether any real meeting took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
place of any of the persons above enumerated, which gave occasion for
the monstrous versions of the witnesses at this trial. It is far from
unlikely, that on the apprehension and commitment of Old Demdike, Old
Chattox, Alizon Device, and Anne Redfern to Lancaster, a meeting would
take place of their near relations, and others who might attend from
curiosity, or from its being rumoured that they were themselves
implicated by the confessions of those apprehended, and who by such
attendance sealed their dooms. In all similar fabrications there is
generally some slight foundation of fact, some scintilla of homely
truth, from which, like the inverted apex of a pyramid, the
disproportioned fabric expands. It is possible that, from the simple
occurrence of an unusual attendance at Malking Tower on Good Friday,
not unnatural under the circumstances, some of the witnesses, ignorant
and easily persuaded, might be afterwards led to believe in the
existence of those monstrous superadditions with which the convention
was afterwards clothed. However this may be, there must have been at
hand for working up the materials into a plausible form, some drill
sergeant of evidence behind the curtain, who had his own interest to
serve or revenge to gratify. The two particulars in the narrative that
one feels least disposed to question, are, that James Device stole a
wether from John Robinson of Barley, to provide a family dinner on
Good Friday, and that when the meat was roasted John Bulcock performed
the humble, but very necessary, duty of turning the spit.</p>

as it would for the remainder of his life, be an all-sufficient
stock-in-trade for him, and popular wonder and sympathy, without the
judge's interposition, would provide for his relief and maintenance.
The near apparent connection and correspondence of the <i>damnum
minatum</i> and <i>damnum secutum</i>, in this instance, imposed upon this
unfortunate woman, as it had done upon many others, and gave to her
confession an earnestness which would appear to the unenlightened
spectator to spring only from reality and truth.</p>

<p><a name="S3b">S 3 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>Margaret Pearson.</i>&quot;] This Padiham witch fared better than
her neighbours, being sentenced only to the pillory. Nothing affords a
stronger proof of the vindictive pertinacity with which these
prosecutions were carried on than the fact of this old and helpless
creature being put on her trial three several times upon such evidence
as follows. Chattox, like many other persons in her situation, was
disposed to have as many companions in punishment, crime or no crime,
as she could compass, and denounced her accordingly: &quot;The said
Pearson's wife is as ill as shee.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Ta">T <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>The said Margerie did carrie the said Toade out of the said

than that of Julian Cox, as to which see Glanvil's <i>Collection of
Relations</i>, p. 192:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Another witness swore, that as he passed by Cox her door,
she was taking a pipe of tobacco upon the threshold of her
door, and invited him to come in and take a pipe, which he
did. And as he was talking Julian said to him, Neighbour,
look what a pretty thing there is. He look't down, and there
was a monstrous great toad betwixt his leggs, staring him in
the face. He endeavoured to kill it by spurning it, but
could not hit it. Whereupon Julian bad him forbear, and it
would do him no hurt. But he threw down his pipe and went
home, (which was about two miles off of Julian Cox her
house,) and told his family what had happened, and that he
believed it was one of Julian Cox her devils. After, he was
taking a pipe of tobacco at home, and the same toad appeared
betwixt his leggs. He took the toad out to kill it, and to
his thinking cut it in several pieces, but returning to his
pipe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> the toad still appeared. He endeavoured to burn it,
but could not. At length he took a switch and beat it. The
toad ran several times about the room to avoid him he still
pursuing it with correction. At length the toad cryed and
vanish't, and he was never after troubled with it.</p></div>

<p>Dr. More's comment on the circumstance is written with all the
seriousness so important a part of a witch's supellex deserves. He
commences defending the huntsman, who swore that he hunted a hare, and
when he came to take it up, he found it to be Julian Cox:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those half-witted people thought he swore false, I suppose
because they imagined that what he told implied that Julian
Cox was turned into an hare. Which she was not, nor did his
report imply any such real metamorphosis of her body, but
that these ludicrous d&#230;mons exhibited to the sight of this
huntsman and his doggs the shape of an Hare, one of them
turning himself into such a form, and others hurrying on the
body of Julian near the same place, and at the same
swiftness, but interposing betwixt that hare-like spectre
and her body, modifying the air so that the scene there, to
the beholders sight, was as if nothing but air were there,
and a shew of earth perpetually suited to that where the
hare passed. As I have heard of some painters that have
drawn the sky in an huge large landskip, so lively that the
birds have flown against it, thinking it free air, and so
have fallen down. And if painters and juglers by the tricks
of legerdemain can do such strange feats to the deceiving of
the sight, it is no wonder that these airy invisible spirits
as far surpass them in all such pr&#230;stigious doings as the
air surpasses the earth for subtilty.</p>

<p>And the like pr&#230;stigi&#230; may be in the toad. It might be a
real toad (though actuated and guided by a d&#230;mon) which was
cut in pieces, and that also which was whipt about, and at
last snatcht out of sight (as if it had vanished) by these
aerial hocus-pocus's. And if some juglers have tricks to
take hot coals into their mouth without hurt, certainly it
is not surprising that some small attempt did not suffice to
burn that toad. That such a toad, sent by a witch and
crawling up the body of the man of the house as he sate by

together, and burnt in the fire; I have heard credibly
reported by one of the Isle of Ely. <i>Of these d&#230;moniack

that of the toad.&#8212;<i>Glanvil's Collection of Relations</i>, p.

<p><a name="T2a1">T 2 <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Isabel Robey.</i>&quot; This person was of Windle, in the parish
of Prescot, a considerable distance from Pendle. The Gerards were
lords of the manor of Windle. Sir Thomas Gerard, before whom the
examinations were taken, was created baronet, 22nd May, 9th James I.;
and thrice married. From him the present Sir John Gerard, of New Hall,
near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> Warrington, is descended. Sir Thomas was determined that the
hundred of West Derby should have its witch as well as the other parts
of the county. A more melancholy tissue of absurd and incoherent
accusations than those against this last of the prisoners convicted on
this occasion, it would not be easy to find; who was hanged, for all
that appears, because one person was suddenly &quot;pinched on her thigh,
as she thought, with four fingers and a thumb,&quot; and because another
was &quot;sore pained with a great warch in his bones.&quot;</p>

according to Master Potts's account. If the crop of each of these was
over abundant, it was from no fault of the learned judges, who, in
their commissions of <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>, subjected it pretty
liberally to the pruning-hook of the executioner.</p>

<p>Sixteen persons reported dead of this common epidemic, besides a
countless number with pains and &quot;starkness in their limbs,&quot; and &quot;a
great warch in their bones!&quot; No wonder that Doctors Bromley and Potts
thought active treatment necessary, with a decided preference for
hemp, as the leading specific.</p>

<p><a name="T3b">T 3 <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>With great warch in his bones.</i>&quot;] Warch is a word well

when wisdom was an extremely scarce commodity.</p>

persons, with the exception of Alice Gray, do not appear, nor is it
said where their places of residence were. Alice Gray was reputed to
have been at the meeting of witches at Malkin's Tower, and to her the
judge refers, perhaps, in particular, when he says, &quot;Without question,
there are amongst you that are as deepe in this action as any of them
that are condemned to die for their offences.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Xb">X <i>b</i></a>. &quot;<i>The Execution of the Witches.</i>&quot;] We could have dispensed with
many of the flowers of rhetoric with which the pages of this discovery
are strewed, if Master Potts would have favoured us with a plain,
unvarnished account of what occurred at this execution. It is here, in
the most interesting point of all, that his narrative, in other
respects so full and abundant, stops short, and seems curtailed of its
just proportions. The &quot;learned and worthy preacher,&quot; to whom the
prisoners were commended by the judge, was probably Mr. William Leigh,
of Standish, before mentioned. Amongst his papers or correspondence,
if they should happen to have been preserved, some account may
eventually be found of the sad closing scene of these melancholy
victims of superstition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="X2a">X 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Neither can I paint in extraordinarie tearmes.</i>&quot;] The

<p><a name="Ya1">Y <i>a</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Hauing cut off Thomas Lister, Esquire, father to this

Listers, Lords Ribblesdale, married Jane, daughter of John Greenacres,
Esquire, of Worston, county of Lancaster, and was buried at Gisburn,
February 8th, 1607. His son, Thomas Lister, referred to as the
&quot;gentleman now living,&quot; married Jane, daughter of Thomas Heber, Esq.,
of Marton, after mentioned, and was buried at Gisburn, July 10th,
1619.</p>

<p><a name="Ya2">Y <i>a</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Was Indicted and Arraigned for the murder of a Child of one
Dodg-sonnes.</i>&quot;] One acquittal was no protection to these unhappy
creatures. It caused only additional exasperation, and, sooner or
later, they were brought within what Donne calls &quot;the hungry statutes'
gaping jaws.&quot; Whether superstition or malice prompted this
prosecution, on the part of Mr. Lister, it is difficult to say. Some
grudge he entertained, or cause of offence he had taken up against
this Jennet Preston, might be her death warrant in those days, when it
was penal for a woman to be old, helpless, ugly, and poor. She was not
so fortunate as the females tried at York, nine years afterwards, for
bewitching the children of Edward Fairfax, of Fuyston, in the forest
of Knaresborough, to whom we owe the only English translation of Tasso
worthy of the name. These females, six in number, were indicted at two
successive assizes, and every effort was made by the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Prevailing poet! whose undoubting mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believed the magic wonders which he sung,&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to procure their conviction. Never was a more unequal contest. On the
one side was a relentless antagonist, armed with wealth, influence,
learning, and accomplishments, and whose family connections gave him
an unlimited power in the county; and on the other, six helpless
persons, whose sex, age, and poverty were almost sufficient for their
condemnation, without any evidence at all. Yet, owing to the
magnanimous firmness of the judge, whose name, deserving of immortal
honour, I regret has not been preserved, these efforts were
frustrated, and the women accused delivered from the gulph which
yawned before them. The disappointment he experienced in this
instance, in being defrauded, as he thought, of a conviction for
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> he had strained every nerve and sinew, and in not being allowed
to render the forest of Knaresborough as famous as that of Pendle,
cast a gloom of despondency over the remaining days of this admirable
poet, who has left a narration of the whole transaction, of most
singular interest and curiosity, yet unpublished. The MSS. now in my
possession, and which came from Mr. Bright's collection, consists of
seventy-eight closely-written folio pages. It is entitled &quot;A Discourse
of Witchcraft, as it was enacted in the family of Mr. Edward Fairfax,
of Fuystone, coun. Ebor, 1621.&quot; From page 78 to 144 are a series of
ninety-three most extraordinary and spirited sketches, made with the
pen, of the witches, devils, monsters, and apparitions referred to in
the narrative.</p>

<p><a name="Y2a">Y 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Master Heyber.</i>&quot;] This was Thomas Hayber, or Heber, of
Marton, in Craven, Esquire, who was buried at Marton, 7th February,
1633. He was the ancestor of Bishop Reginald Heber and the late
Richard Heber, Esq.</p>

<p><a name="Y3a">Y 3 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>The said Iennet Preston comming to touch the dead corpes,
they bled fresh bloud presently.</i>&quot;] On the popular superstition of
touching the corpse of a murdered person, as an ordeal or test for the
discovery of the innocence or guilt of suspected murderers, the reader
cannot better be referred than to the very learned and elaborate essay
in Pitcairne's <i>Criminal Trials</i>, vol. iii. p. 182-189. Amongst the
authors there quoted, Webster is omitted, who, (see <i>Displaying of
supposed Witchcraft</i>, p. 304,) discusses the point at considerable
length, and with an earnest and implicit faith singularly at variance
with his enlightened scepticism in other matters. But there were
regions of superstition in which even this Sampson of logic became
imbecile and powerless. The rationale of the bleeding of a murdered
corpse at the touch of the murderer is given by Sir Kenelm Digby with
his usual force and spirit:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To this cause, peradventure, may be reduced the strange
effect which is frequently seen in England, when, <i>at the
approach of the Murderer, the slain body suddenly bleedeth
afresh</i>. For certainly the Souls of them that are
treacherously murdered by surprise, use to leaue their
bodies with extreme unwillingness, and with vehement
indignation against them that force them to so unprovided
and abhorred a passage! That Soul, then, to wreak its evil
talent against the hated Murderer, and to draw a just and
desired revenge upon his head, would do all it can to
manifest the author of the fact! To <i>speak</i> it cannot&#8212;for
in itself it wanteth the organs of voice; and those it is
parted from are now grown too heavy, and are too benummed,
for to give motion unto: Yet some change it desireth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
make in the body, which it hath so vehement inclination to;
and therefore is the aptest for it to work upon. It must
then endeavour to cause a motion in the subtilest and most
fluid parts (and consequently the most moveable ones) of it.
This can be nothing but <span class="smcap">the blood</span>, which then being
violently moved, <i>must needs gush out at those places where
it findeth issue</i>!</p></div>

<p>In the two following Scotch cases of witchcraft, this test was
resorted to. The first was that of</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Marioun Peebles</span>,<a name="FNanchor_79_83" id="FNanchor_79_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_83" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> <i>alias</i> Pardone, spouse to <span class="smcap">Swene</span>, in
Hildiswick, who was, on March 22, 1644, sentenced to be
strangled at a stake, and burnt to ashes, at <i>the Hill of
Berrie</i>, for <span class="smcap">Witchcraft</span> and <span class="smcap">Murder</span>. Marion and her husband
having 'ane deadlie and venefical malice in her heart'
against Edward Halero in Overure, and being determined 'to
destroy and put him down,' being 'transformed in the lyknes
of ane pellack-quhaill, (the Devill changing her spirit,
quhilk fled in the same quhaill,') and the said Edward and
other four individuals being in a fishing-boat, coming from
the Sea, at the North-banks of Hildiswick, 'on ane fair
morning, did cum under the said boat, and overturnit her
with ease, and drowned and devoired thame in the sey, right
at the shore, when there wis na danger wtherwayis.' The
bodies of Halero and another of these hapless fishermen
having been found, Marion and Swene 'wir sent for, and

<p>A similar and very remarkable instance is related in the
following Triall: In the Dittay of <span class="smcap">Christian Wilson</span>, alias
<i>the Lanthorne</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_87" id="FNanchor_83_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_87" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> accused of Murder, Witchcraft, &amp;c.,
(which is founded upon the examinations of James Wilson,
Abraham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> Macmillan, William Crichton, and Fyfe and George
Erskine, &amp;c. led before Sir William Murray of Newtoun, and
other Commissioners, at Dalkeith, Jun. 14, 1661,) it is
stated, that 'Ther being enimitie betuixt the said
Christiane and Alexander Wilsone, her brother, and shoe
having often tymes threatned him, at length, about 7 or 8
monthes since, altho' the said Alexander was sene that day

<p><a name="Za">Z <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>Master Leonard Lister.</i>&quot;] This Leonard Lister was the brother
of Master Thomas Lister, for whose murder Jennet Preston was indicted;
and married Ann, daughter of &#8212;&#8212; Loftus, of Coverham Abbey, county of
York.</p>

<p><a name="Z2a">Z 2 <i>a</i></a>. &quot;<i>His Lordship commanded the Iurie to obserue the particular
circumstances.</i>&quot;] The judge in this case was Altham, who seems even to
have been more superstitious, bigotted, and narrow-minded than his
brother in commission, Bromley. Fenner, who tried the witches of
Warbois, and Archer, before whom the trial of Julian Cox took place,
are the only judges I can meet with, quite on a level with this
learned baron in grovelling absurdity, upon whom &quot;Jennet Preston would
lay heavy at the time of his death,&quot; whether she had so lain upon Mr.
Thomas Lister or not, if bigotry, habit, and custom did not render him
seared and callous to conscience and pity.</p>

<p><a name="Z3b1">Z 3 <i>b</i> 1</a>. &quot;<i>Take example by this Gentlemen to prosecute these hellish
Furies to their end.</i>&quot;] It is marvellous that Potts does not, like
Delrio, recommend the rack to be applied to witches &quot;in moderation,
and according to the regulations of Pope Pius the Third, and so as not
to cripple the criminal for life.&quot; Not that this learned Jesuit is
much averse to simple dislocations occasioned by the rack. These, he
thinks, cannot be avoided in the press of business. He is rather
opposed, though in this he speaks doubtfully and with submission to
authority, to those tortures which fracture the bones or lacerate the
tendons. Verily, the Catholic and the Protestant author might have
shaken hands; they were, beyond dispute, <i>p&#339;ne Gemelli</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Z3b2">Z 3 <i>b</i> 2</a>. &quot;<i>Posterities.</i>&quot;] Master Potts, of the particulars of whose
life nothing is known, made, as far as can be discovered, no further
attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> acquire fame in the character of an author. No subject so
interesting probably again occurred, as that which had diversified his
legal pursuits &quot;in his lodgings in Chancery-lane,&quot; from the pleasing
recollections associated with his Summer Circuit of 1612. He was not,
however, the only person of the name of Pott, or Potts, who
distinguished himself in the field of Witchcraft. The author of the
following tract, in my possession, might have garnished it with
various flowers from the <a href="#DISCOVERIE">work</a> now reprinted, if he had been aware of
such a repository: &quot;Pott (Joh. Henr.) De nefando Lamiarum cum Diabolo
coitu.&quot; 4to. Lond. 1689. The other celebrated cases of supposed
witchcraft occurring in the county of Lancaster, besides those
connected with the foregoing republication, are, the extraordinary one
of Ferdinand, Earl of Derby, who died at Latham in 1594, for which the
reader is referred to Camden's <i>Annals of Elizabeth</i>, years 1593,
1594; Kennet, 2. 574, 580; or Pennant's <i>Tour from Downing to Alston
Moor</i>, p. 29;&#8212;the case of Edmund Hartley, hanged at Lancaster in
1597, for bewitching some members of the family of Mr. Starkie, of
Cleworth, which will be fully considered in the proposed republication
of the Chetham Society, which gives the history of that event;&#8212;and
lastly, that of a person of the name of Utley, (Whitaker, p. 528;
Baines, vol. i. p. 604,) who was hanged at Lancaster about 1630, for
having bewitched to death Richard, the son of Ralph Assheton, Esq.,
Lord of Middleton, of whose trial, unfortunately, no report is in
existence. Webster also mentions two supposed witches as having been
put to death at Lancaster, within eighteen years before his
<i>Displaying of supposed Witchcraft</i> was published; and which
occurrence, not referred to by any other historian, must therefore
have taken place about the year 1654.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Take, as an instance, the children of Mr. Throgmorton, of
Warbois, for bewitching whom, Mother Samuels, her husband, and
daughter, suffered in 1593. No veteran professors &quot;in the art of
ingeniously tormenting&quot; could have administered the question with more
consummate skill than these little incarnate fiends, till the poor old
woman was actually induced, from their confident asseverations and
plausible counterfeiting, to believe at last that she had been a witch
all her life without knowing it. She made a confession, following the
story which they had prompted, on their assurances that it was the
only means to restore them, and then was hanged upon that confession,
to which she adhered on the scaffold. Few tracts present a more vivid
picture of manners than that in which the account of this case of
witchcraft is contained. It is perhaps the rarest of the English
tracts relating to witchcraft, and is entitled &quot;The most strange and
admirable Discoverie of the three Witches of Warboys, arraigned,

true but erring and unequal humanity, which are as rare as they are
precious. In the unabridged life of Lord Guildford by Roger North,

additional touches which confirm the general accuracy of the portrait
he has sketched of Hale in the work which has been printed. (Vide

poignant regret than that of Dr. Henry More. So exalted was his
character, so serene and admirable his temper, so full of harmony his
whole intellectual constitution, that, irradiated at once by all the
lights of religion and philosophy, and with clearer glimpses of the
land of vision and the glories behind the veil than perhaps uninspired
mortality ever partook of before, he seems to have reached as near to
the full standard of perfection as it is possible for frail and feeble
humanity to attain. Dr. Outram said that he looked upon Dr. More as
the holiest person upon the face of the earth; and the sceptical
Hobbes, who never dealt in compliment, observed, &quot;That if his own
philosophy were not true, he knew of none that he should sooner like
than More's of Cambridge.&quot; His biographer, Ward, concludes his life in
the following glowing terms:&#8212;&quot;Thus lived and died the eminent Dr.
More: thus set this bright and illustrious star, vanishing by degrees
out of our sight after, to the surprise and admiration of many, (like
that which was observed in Cassiopeia's chair,) it had illuminated, as
it were, both worlds so long at once.&quot; At the lapse of many years I
have not forgotten the impassioned fondness with which the late and
most lamented Robert Southey dwelt upon the memory of the Cambridge
Plato, or the delight with which he greeted some works of his
favourite author which I was fortunate enough to point out to him,
with which he had not been previously acquainted. The sad reverse of
the picture will be seen by those who consult the folio of More's
philosophical works and Glanville's <i>Sadducismus Triumphatus</i>, the
greatest part of which is derived from More's <i>Collections</i>. His
hallucinations on the subject of witchcraft, from which none of the
English writers of the Platonic school were exempt, are the more
extraordinary, as a sister error, judicial astrology, met in More with
its most able oppugner. His tract, which has excited much less
attention than its merit deserves, (I have not been able to trace a
single quotation from it in any author during the last century,) is
entitled &quot;Tetractys Anti-astrologica, or a Confutation of Astrology.&quot;
Lond. 1681, 4to. I may mention while on the subject of More, that the
second and most valuable part of the memoir of him by Ward, his
devoted admirer and pupil, which was never printed, is in my
possession, in manuscript.</p></div>

to possess a copy of his interdicted <i>Examination of Religions</i>, the
title of which is, &quot;Colloquium heptaplomeres de abditis sublimium

which very few MSS. copies are in existence, are well aware how little
he felt himself shackled in the spirit of examination which he carried
into the most sacred subjects by any respect for popular notions or
received systems or great authorities. My MS. copy of this
extraordinary work, which came from Heber's Collection, is contained

biography, a desideratum which, in an age characterised by its want of
literary research, is not likely to be soon supplied, than Thomas
Erastus, whose theological, philosophical, and medical celebrity
entitle him to rank with the greatest men of his century. At present
we have to collect all that is known of his life from various
scattered and contradictory sources. John Webster, in his <i>Displaying
of Supposed Witchcraft</i>, contrary to the usual candour and fairness of
his judgments, speaks slightingly of Erastus. There was, however, a
sufficient reason for this. Erastus had shown up the empiricism of
Webster's idol Paracelsus, and was in great disfavour with the writers
of the Anti-Galenic school.</p></div>

he seldom is deficient in. Like all Bodin's works, it has a spirit
peculiarly his own, and is, in my opinion, one of the most
entertaining books to be found in the circle of Demonology.</p></div>

to his <i>Discoverie</i>, he observes:&#8212;
</p><p>
&quot;I see among other malefactors manie poore old women conuented before
you for working of miracles, other wise called witchcraft, and
therefore I thought you also a meet person to whom I might commend my
booke.&quot;&#8212;And he then proceeds, in the following spirited and gallant
strain, to run his course against the Dagon of popular superstition:&#8212;
</p><p>
&quot;I therefore (at this time) doo onelie desire you to consider of my
report, concerning the euidence that is commonlie brought before you
against them. See first whether the euidence be not friuolous, &amp;
whether the proofs brought against them be not incredible, consisting
of ghesses, presumptions, &amp; impossibilities contrarie to reason,
scripture, and nature. See also what persons complaine vpon them,
whether they be not of the basest, the vnwisest, &amp; most faithles kind
of people. Also may it please you to waie what accusations and crimes
they laie to their charge, namelie: She was at my house of late, she
would haue had a pot of milke, she departed in a chafe bicause she had
it not, she railed, she curssed, she mumbled and whispered, and
finallie she said she would be euen with me: and soone after my child,
my cow, my sow, or my pullet died, or was strangelie taken. Naie (if
it please your Worship) I haue further proofe: I was with a wise
woman, and she told me I had an ill neighbour, &amp; that she would come
to my house yer it were long, and so did she; and that she had a marke
aboue hir waste, &amp; so had she: and God forgiue me, my stomach hath
gone against hir a great while. Hir mother before hir was counted a
witch, she hath beene beaten and scratched by the face till bloud was
drawne vpon hir, bicause she hath beene suspected, &amp; afterwards some
of those persons were said to amend. These are the certeinties that I
heare in their euidences.
</p><p>
&quot;<i>Note also how easilie they may be brought to confesse that which
they neuer did, nor lieth in the power of man to doo</i>: and then see
whether I haue cause to write as I doo. Further, if you shall see that
infidelitie, poperie, and manie other manifest heresies be backed and
shouldered, and their professors animated and hartened, by yeelding to
creatures such infinit power as is wrested out of Gods hand, and
attributed to witches: finallie, if you shall perceiue that I haue
faithfullie and trulie deliuered and set downe the condition and state
of the witch, and also of the witchmonger, and haue confuted by reason
and lawe, and by the word of God it selfe, all mine aduersaries
obiections and arguments: then let me haue your countenance against
them that maliciouslie oppose themselues against me.
</p><p>
&quot;<i>My greatest aduersaries are yoong ignorance and old custome.</i> For
what follie soeuer tract of time hath fostered, it is so
superstitiouslie pursued of some, as though no error could be
acquainted with custome. But if the lawe of nations would ioine with
such custome, to the maintenance of ignorance, and to the suppressing
of knowledge; the ciuilest countrie in the world would soone become
barbarous, &amp;c. For as knowledge and time discouereth errors, so dooth
superstition and ignorance in time breed them.&quot;
</p><p>
The passage which I next quote, is a further specimen of the
impressive and even eloquent earnestness with which he pleads his
cause:&#8212;
</p><p>
&quot;In the meane time, I would wish them to know that if neither the
estimation of Gods omnipotencie, nor the tenor of his word, nor the
doubtfulnes or rather the impossibilitie of the case, nor the small
proofes brought against them, nor the rigor executed vpon them, nor
the pitie that should be in a christian heart, nor yet their
simplicitie, impotencie, or age may suffice to suppresse the rage or
rigor wherewith they are oppressed; yet the consideration of their sex
or kind ought to mooue some mitigation of their punishment. For if
nature (as Plinie reporteth) haue taught a lion not to deale so
roughlie with a woman as with a man, bicause she is in bodie the
weaker vessell, and in hart more inclined to pitie (which Ieremie in
his lamentations seemeth to confirme) what should a man doo in this
case, for whome a woman was created as an helpe and comfort vnto him?
In so much as, euen in the lawe of nature, it is a greater offense to
slea a woman than a man: not bicause a man is not the more excellent
creature, but bicause a woman is the weaker vessell. And therefore
among all modest and honest persons it is thought a shame to offer
violence or iniurie to a woman: in which respect Virgil saith, <i>Nullum
memorabile nomen f&#339;minea in p&#339;na est</i>.
</p><p>
&quot;God that knoweth my heart is witnes, and you that read my booke shall
see, that my drift and purpose in this enterprise tendeth onelie to
these respects. First, that the glorie and power of God be not so
abridged and abased, as to be thrust into the hand or lip of a lewd
old woman: whereby the worke of the Creator should be attributed to
the power of a creature. Secondlie, that the religion of the gospell
may be seene to stand without such peeuish trumperie. Thirdlie, that
lawfull fauour and christian compassion be rather vsed towards these
poore soules, than rigor and extremitie. Bicause they, which are
commonlie accused of witchcraft, are the least sufficient of all other
persons to speake for themselues; as hauing the most base and simple
education of all others; the extremitie of their age giuing them leaue
to dote, their pouertie to beg, their wrongs to chide and threaten (as
being void of anie other waie of reuenge) their humor melancholicall
to be full of imaginations, from whence cheefelie proceedeth the
vanitie of their confessions; as that they can transforme themselues
and others into apes, owles, asses, dogs, cats, &amp;c: that they can flie
in the aire, kill children with charmes, hinder the comming of butter,
&amp;c.
</p><p>
&quot;And for so much as the mightie helpe themselues together, and the
poore widowes crie, though it reach to heauen, is scarse heard here
vpon earth: I thought good (according to my poore abilitie) to make
intercession, that some part of common rigor, and some points of
hastie iudgement may be aduised vpon. For the world is now at that
stay (as Brentius in a most godlie sermon in these words affirmeth)
that euen as when the heathen persecuted the christians, if anie were
accused to beleeue in Christ, the common people cried <i>Ad leonem</i>: so
now, if anie woman, be she neuer so honest, be accused of witchcraft,
they crie <i>Ad ignem</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> In the intervening period between the publication of
Soot's work and the advertisement of Filmer, several books came out on
the subject of witchcraft. Amongst them it is right to notice &quot;A
Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraft, by George Giffard,
Minister of God's Word in Maldon,&quot; 1593, 4to. This tract, which has
been reprinted by the Percy Society, is not free from the leading
fallacies which infected the reasonings of almost all the writers on
witchcraft. It is, nevertheless, exceedingly entertaining, and well
deserves a perusal, if only as transmitting to us, in their full
freshness, the racy colloquialisms of the age of Elizabeth. It is to
be hoped that the other works of Giffard, all of which are deserving
of attention, independently of their theological interest, as
specimens of pure and sterling English, may appear in a collected
form. The next tract requiring notice is &quot;The Trial of Witchcraft, by
John Cotta,&quot; 1616, 4to, of which a second and enlarged edition was
published in 1624. Cotta, who was a physician of great eminence and
experience, residing at Northampton, has supplied in this very able,
learned, and vigorous treatise, a groundwork which, if pursued to its
just results, for he writes very cautiously and guardedly, and rather
hints at his conclusions than follows them out, would have sufficed to
have overthrown many of the positions of the supporters of the system
of witchcraft. His work has a strong scholastic tinge, and is not
without occasional obscurity; and on these accounts probably produced
no very extensive impression at the time. He wrote two other
tracts&#8212;1. &quot;Discovery of the Dangers of ignorant practisers of Physick
in England,&quot; 1612, 4to; 2. &quot;Cotta contra Antonium, or An Ant-Anthony,&quot;
Oxford, 1623, 4to; the latter of which, a keen satire against the
chymists' aurum potabile, is exceedingly rare. Both are intrinsically
valuable and interesting, and written with great vigour of style, and
are full of curious illustrations derived from his extensive medical
practice. I cannot conclude this note without adverting to Gaule's
amusing little work, (&quot;Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and
Witchcraft, by John Gaule, Preacher of the Word at Great Haughton, in
the county of Huntingdon,&quot; 1646, 24mo.) which gives us all the
casuistry applicable to witchcraft. We can almost forgive Gaule's
fundamental errors on the general question, for the courage and spirit
with which he battled with the villainous witchfinder, Hopkins, who
wanted sorely to make an example of him, to the terror of all
gainsayers of the sovereign power of this examiner-general of witches.
Gaule proved himself to be an overmatch for the itinerating
inquisitor, and so effectually attacked, battled with, and exposed
him, as to render him quite harmless in future. The minister of Great
Haughton was made of different metal to the &quot;old reading parson
Lewis,&quot; or Lowes, to whose fate Baxter refers with such nonchalance.
As the only clergyman of the Church of England, that I am aware of,
who was executed for witchcraft, Lewis's case is sufficiently
interesting to merit some notice. Stearne's (vide his <i>Confirmation of
Witchcraft</i>, p. 23,) account of it, which I have not seen quoted
before, is as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>
&quot;Thus was Parson Lowis taken, who had been a Minister, (as I have
heard) in one Parish above forty yeares, in Suffolke, before he was
condemned, but had been indited for a common imbarriter, and for
Witchcraft, above thirty yeares before, and the grand Jury (as I have
heard) found the bill for a common imbarriter, who now, after he was
found with the markes, in his confession, he confessed, that in pride
of heart, to be equall, or rather above God, the Devill tooke
advantage of him, and hee covenanted with the Devill, and sealed it
with his bloud, and had three Familiars or spirits, which sucked on
the markes found upon his body, and did much harme, both by Sea and
Land, especially by Sea, for he confessed, that he being at Lungarfort
in Suffolke, where he preached, as he walked upon the wall, or workes
there, he saw a great saile of Ships passe by, and that as they were
sailing by, one of his three Impes, namely his yellow one, forthwith
appeared to him, and asked him what hee should doe, and he bade it goe
and sinke such a Ship, and shewed his Impe a new Ship, amongst the
middle of the rest (as I remember) one that belonged to Ipswich, so he
confessed the Impe went forthwith away, and he stood still, and viewed
the Ships on the Sea as they were a sayling, and perceived that Ship
immediately, to be in more trouble and danger then the rest; for he
said, the water was more boystrous neere that then the rest, tumbling
up and down with waves, as if water had been boyled in a pot, and
soone after (he said) in a short time it sanke directly downe into the
Sea, as he stood and viewed it, when all the rest sayled away in
safety, there he confessed, he made fourteen widdowes in one quarter
of an houre. Then Mr. Hopkin, as he told me (for he tooke his
Confession) asked him, if it did not grieve him to see so many men
cast away, in a short time, and that he should be the cause of so many
poore widdowes on a suddaine, but he swore by his maker, no, he was
joyfull to see what power his Impes had, and so likewise confessed
many other mischiefes, and had a charme to keep him out of Goale, and
hanging, as he paraphrased it himselfe, but therein the Devill
deceived him; for he was hanged, that Michaelmas time 1645. at Burie
Saint Edmunds, but he made a very farre larger confession, which I
have heard hath been printed: but if it were so, it was neither of Mr.
Hopkins doing nor mine owne; for we never printed anything untill
now.&quot;
</p><p>
Hutchinson gives the explanation of this confession. What can be more
atrocious than the whole story, which is yet but the common story of
witch confessions?
</p><p>
&quot;<i>Adv.</i> Then did not he confess this before the Commissioners, at the
Time of his Tryal?
</p><p>
&quot;<i>Clerg.</i> No, but maintained his Innocence stoutly, and challenged
them to make Proof of such Things as they laid to his Charge. I had
this from a Person of Credit, who was then in Court, and heard his
Tryal. I may add, that tho' his Case is remembered better than others
that suffered, yet I never heard any one speak of him, but with great
Compassion, because of his Age and Character, and their Belief of his
Innocence: And when he came to his Execution, because he would have
Christian Burial, he read the Office himself, and that way committed
his own Body to the Ground, in sure and certain Hope of the
Resurrection to eternal Life.
</p><p>
&quot;In the Notes upon those Verses that I quoted out of Hudibras, it is
said, that he had been a painful Preacher for many Years, I may add
for Fifty, for so long he had been Vicar of Brandeston in the County
of Suffolk, as appears by the Time of his Institution. That I might
know the present Sense of the Chief Inhabitants of that Place, I wrote
to Mr. Wilson, the Incumbent of that Town, and by his Means received
the following Letter from Mr. Rivett, a worthy Gentleman who lived
lately in the same Place, and whose Father lived there before him.
</p><p>
&quot;'SIR,
</p><p>
&quot;'<span class="smcap">In</span> Answer to your Request concerning Mr. Lowes, my Father was always
of the opinion, that Mr. Lowes suffered wrongfully, and hath often
said, that he did believe, he was no more a Wizzard than he was. I
have heard it from them that watched with him, that <i>they kept him
awake several Nights together, and run him backwards and forwards
about the Room, until he was out of Breath: Then they rested him a
little, and then ran him again: And thus they did for several Days and
Nights together, till he was weary of his Life, and was scarce
sensible of what he said or did</i>. They swam him at Framlingham, but
that was no true Rule to try him by; for they put in honest People at
the same Time, and they swam as well as he.&quot;</p></div>

published too important in this controversy to be passed over without

the Nature of Witches and Witchcraft; being Advice to Judges,
Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and Grand Jurymen, what to do before
they passe sentence on such as are arraigned for their lives as
Witches. By Thomas Ady, M.A. London, printed for R.J., to be sold by
Thomas Newberry, at the Three Lions in Cornhill, by the Exchange,
1656</i>, 4to. Ady, of whom, unfortunately, nothing is known, presses the
arguments against the witchmongers and witchfinders with unanswerable
force. In fact, this tract comprises the quintessence of all that had
been urged against the popular system, and his &quot;Candle&quot; was truly a
burning and a shining light. His Dedication is too curious to be
omitted:&#8212;
</p><p>
&quot;To the Prince of the Kings of the Earth. It is the manner of men, O
heavenly King, to dedicate their books to some great men, thereby to
have their works protected and countenanced among them; but thou only
art able, by thy holy Spirit of Truth, to defend thy Truth, and to
make it take impression in the heart and understanding of men. Unto
thee alone do I dedicate this work, entreating thy Most High Majesty
to grant, that whoever shall open this book, thy holy Spirit may so
possess their understanding, as that the Spirit of errour may depart
from them, and that they may read and try thy Truth by the touchstone
of thy Truth, the holy Scriptures; and finding that Truth, may embrace
it and forsake their darksome inventions of Antichrist, that have
deluded and defiled the nations now and in former ages. Enlighten the
world, thou that art the Light of the World, and let darkness be no
more in the world, now or in any future age; but make all people to
walk as children of the Light for ever; and destroy Antichrist, that
hath deceived the nations, and save us the residue by thyself alone;
and let not Satan any more delude us, for the Truth is thine for
ever.&quot; He then puts his &quot;Dilemma that cannot be answered by
Witchmongers.&quot; It is too long to quote, but it is a dilemma that would
pose the stoutest Coryph&#230;us of the party to whom he addressed
himself.</p></div>

was. Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
greedily after the Errors of Balaam, for Reward, and Perished in the
Gainsaying of Core. These are Spots in your Feasts of Charity, when

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Dr. Whitaker's assertion, that Webster was &quot;neglected
alike by the wise and unwise,&quot; seems to be a mere <i>gratis dictum</i>. The
age of folios was rapidly passing away; but few folios of the period
appear to have been more generally read, if we are to judge at least
from its being frequently mentioned and quoted, than Webster's
<i>Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft</i>. The same able writer's &quot;Doubt
whether Sir Matthew Hale ever read Webster's <i>Discovery of Supposed
Witchcraft</i>,&quot; might easily have been satisfied by a reference to any
common life of that great judge, which would have shown the historian
of Whalley that Hale died before the book was published. Nor is Dr.
Whitaker correct in stating that all tradition of Webster is now lost
in the neighbourhood where he resided. The following anecdote, which
would have delighted him, I had from an old inhabitant of Burnley, to
whom it had been handed down by his grandfather:&#8212;In the days of
Webster's fanaticism, during the usurpation, he is stated, in the
zealous crusade then so common against superstitious relics, to have
headed a party by whom the three venerable crosses, now set up in the
churchyard of Whalley, commonly called the Crosses of Paulinus, and
supposed to be coeval with the first preaching of Christianity in the
North of England, were removed and taken away from their site and
appropriated as a boundary fence for some adjoining fields. After the
Restoration, and when his religious views had become sobered and
settled, he is said, in an eager desire to atone for the desecration
of which he had been guilty, to have purchased the crosses from the
person who was then in possession of them, and to have been at the
cost of re-erecting them on their present site, from which no
sacrilegious hand will, I trust, ever again remove them. It is further
said, that Webster's favourite and regular walk, in the latter part of
his life, till his infirmities rendered him unable to take exercise of
any kind, was to the remains of Whalley Abbey; and that a path along
the banks of the stream which glides by those most picturesque and
pleasing ruins, was long called &quot;Webster's Walk.&quot; If this tradition be
founded in fact, and I give it as I received it, John Webster, of
Clitheroe, if not identical, as Mr. Collier has contended, with the
dramatic poet of that name, must have felt something assimilated in
spirit to the fine inspiration of those noble lines of the latter:&#8212;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Webster's death took place on the 18th June, 1682. He
left an extensive library, composed principally of chemical,
hermetical, and philosophical works, of which the MSS. catalogue is
now in the possession of my friend, the Rev. T. Corser. I have two
books which appear to have at one time formed part of his collection,
from having his favourite signature, Johannes Hyphantes, in his
autograph, on the title pages. Before I conclude with Webster, I ought
perhaps to observe, that in the valuable edition of the works of
Webster, the dramatic poet, published by the Rev. A. Dyce, that most
accurate and judicious editor has proved indisputably, by an elaborate
argument, that the John Webster, the writer of the <i>Examen
Academiarum</i>, and John Webster, the author of the <i>Displaying of
Supposed Witchcraft</i>, were one and the same person, who was not
identical with the dramatic writer of the same name. Mr. Dyce does
not, however, appear to have been aware, that the identity of the
author of the <i>Examen Academiarum</i> and the writer on witchcraft is
distinctly stated by Dr. Henry More, in his <i>Pr&#230;fatio Generalissima</i>,
to the Latin edition of his works, whose testimony being that of a
contemporary, who was, like Webster, &quot;a Cambridge scholar,&quot; may
perhaps be considered sufficient, without resorting to internal and
circumstantial evidence. The inscription on Webster's monument in the
chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, at Clitheroe, is too characteristic and
curious to be omitted. I give it entire:&#8212;

the plaster are yet to be found imbedded in the boundary wall of the

most extensive prospect in front, in the direction of Alkincoates,
Colne, and the Yorkshire moors; while in another direction the vast
range of Pendle, nearly intercepted, gloomed in sullen majesty. At the

historian of Cheshire, George Ormerod, Esq., Dr. Whitaker, to whom the
volume formerly belonged, has been at the pains of chronicling the
superstitions connected with a family, ranking amongst the more
opulent yeomen of Cliviger, of the name of Briercliffe, on the
execution of one of whom for murder the tract was published. The
Briercliffe's, from the curious anecdotes which the Doctor gives with
great unction, appear to have been one of those gloomy and fated
races, dogged by some unassuageable Nemesis, in which crime and horror
are transmitted from generation to generation with as much certainty

at all at length into the detail of the various cases; but his
materials were generally collected from common sources, and he
confines himself principally to English cases. The European history of
witchcraft embraces so wide a field, and requires for its just
completion a research so various, that there is little probability, I
fear, of this <i>desideratum</i> being speedily supplied.</p></div>

Nutter, Rough Lee, still standing. It is impossible to look at it,
recollecting the circumstances of her case, without being strongly
interested. It is a very substantial, and rather a fine specimen of
the houses of the inferior gentry in the time of James the first, and
is now divided into cottages. On one of the side walls is an
inscription, almost entirely obliterated, which contained the date of
the building and the initials of the name of its first owner. At a
little distance from Rough Lee, pursuing the course of the stream, he
will find the foundations of an ancient mill, and the millstones still
unremoved, though the building itself has been pulled down long ago.
This was, doubtless, the mill of Richard Baldwin, the miller, who, as
stated in Old Demdike's confession, ejected her and Alizon Device her
daughter, from his land so contumeliously; immediately after which her
&quot;Spirit or divell called Tibb appeared, and sayd Revenge thee of him.&quot;
Greenhead, the residence of Robert Nutter, one of the reputed victims
of the prisoners tried on this occasion, is at some distance from
Rough Lee, and is yet in good preservation, and occupied as a

statute of James the first was brought to bear against any but the
lowest classes of the people. Indeed, there are not many attempts
reported to attack the rich and powerful with weapons derived from its
provisions. One of such attempts, which did not, like that against
Alice Nutter, prove successful, is narrated in a curious and scarce
pamphlet, which I have now before me, with this title&#8212;&quot;Wonderful News
from the North, or a true Relation of the sad and grievous Torments
inflicted upon the Bodies of three children of Mr. George Muschamp,
late of the County of Northumberland, by Witchcraft, and how
miraculously it pleased God to strengthen them and to deliver them; as
also the prosecution of the say'd Witches, as by Oaths and their own
Confessions will appear, and by the Indictment found by the Jury
against one of them at the Sessions of the Peace held at Alnwick, the
24th day of April, 1650. London, printed by T.H., and are to be sold
by Richard Harper at his Shop in Smithfield. 1650,&quot; 4to. This was
evidently a diabolical plot, in which these children were made the

writing hereof, and commonly known by the name of Ned of Roughs) whose
Father was by trade a Waller, and but a poor Man, and they finding
that they were believed and had incouragement by the adjoyning
Magistrates, and the persons being committed to prison or bound over
to the next Assizes, the boy, his Father and some others besides did
make a practice to go from Church to Church that the Boy might reveal
and discover Witches, pretending that there was a great number at the
pretended meeting whose faces he could know, and by that means they
got a good living, that in a short space the Father bought a Cow or
two, when he had none before. And it came to pass that this said Boy
was brought into the Church of Kildwick a large parish Church, where I
(being then Curate there) was preaching in the afternoon, and was set
upon a stall (he being but about ten or eleven years old) to look
about him, which moved some little disturbance in the Congregation for
a while. And after prayers I inquiring what the matter was, the people
told me that it was the Boy that discovered Witches, upon which I went
to the house where he was to stay all night, where I found him, and
two very unlikely persons that did conduct him, and manage the
business; I desired to have some discourse with the Boy in private,
but that they utterly refused; then in the presence of a great many
people, I took the Boy near me, and said: Good Boy tell me truly, and
in earnest, did thou see and hear such strange things of the meeting
of Witches, as is reported by many that thou dost relate, or did not
some person teach thee to say such things of thy self? But the two men
not giving the Boy leave to answer, did pluck him from me, and said he
had been examined by two able Justices of the Peace, and they did
never ask him such a question, to whom I replied, the persons accused
had therefore the more wrong.&quot;&#8212;Webster's <i>Displaying of Witchcraft</i>,

It is very probable that they had seen and conversed with the boy, to

The Lancashire dialect, as given in this play, and by no means
unfaithfully, was perhaps derived from conversations with some of the

any that Heywood's imagination ever bodied forth from the world of

Drage, in his &quot;Treatise of Diseases from Witchcraft,&quot; published Lond.
1668, 4to. p. 22, recommends &quot;birch&quot; in such cases, &quot;as a specifical
medicine, antipathetical to demons.&quot; One can only lament that this
valuable remedy was not vigorously applied in the present instance, as
well as in most others in which these juvenile sufferers appear. I
doubt whether, in the whole Materia Medica, a more powerful
<i>Lamia-fuge</i> could have been discovered, or one which would have been
more universally successful, if applied perseveringly, whenever the
suspicious symptoms recurred. The following is, however, Drage's great
panacea in these cases, a mode of treatment which must have been
vastly popular, judging from its extensive adoption in all parts of
the country: &quot;<i>Punish the witch, threaten to hang her if she helps not
the sick, scratch her and fetch blood. When she is cast into prison
the sick are some time delivered, some time he or she (they are most
females, most old women, and most poor,) must transfer the disease to
other persons, sometimes to a dog, or horse, or cow, &amp;c. Threaten her
and beat her to remove it.</i>&quot;&#8212;Drage, p. 23.</p></div>

imposture:&#8212;&quot;Four of them, to wit Margaret Johnson, Francis Dicconson,
Mary Spenser, and Hargraves Wife, were sent for up to London, and were
viewed and examined by his Majesties Physicians and Chirurgeons, and
after by his Majesty and the Council, and no cause of guilt appearing
but great presumptions of the boys being suborned to accuse them
falsely. Therefore it was resolved to separate the boy from his
Father, they having both followed the women up to London, they were
both taken and put into several prisons asunder. Whereupon shortly
after the Boy confessed that he was taught and suborned to devise, and
feign those things against them, and had persevered in that wickedness
by the counsel of his Father, and some others, whom envy, revenge and
hope of gain had prompted on to that devillish design and villany; and
he also confessed, that upon that day when he said that they met at
the aforesaid house or barn, he was that very day a mile off, getting
Plums in his Neighbours Orchard. And that this is a most certain
truth, there are many persons yet living, of sufficient reputation and
integrity, that can avouch and testifie the same; and besides, what I
write is the most of it true, upon my own knowledge, and the whole I
have had from his own mouth.&quot;&#8212;<i>Displaying of Witchcraft</i>, p. 277.</p></div>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
